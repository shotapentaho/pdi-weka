ashed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and . . . \neventually , hopefully , sometimes , there\'s a breakthrough and we actually get down to work . \namazingly it\'s almost always easier than we dreaded and after finishing , that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away . \nand then , the next time , we do it all again . \nenglish professor grady tripp ( michael douglas ) is a master . \nseven years ago , his first book was a hit . \nhe\'s been working on his second -- a short 200-page piece -- since then . \nfearful that he can\'t live up to the first , he can\'t bring himself to finish it . \nno writer\'s block , he\'s nearing 3 , 000 pages with no end in sight . \nnow he\'s having a particularly difficult day . \nthe college\'s annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing _their_ books . \nduring the first day , his wife has left him , his married girlfriend informs him she\'s pregnant and his agent is in town with a six-foot transvestite in tow . \nby the evening , our besieged writer is driving though the snow-covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him , a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk . \nthis could be a pivotal point in his mid-life crisis . \nand then there\'s the next morning . \nthere\'s a lot to like about this movie . \nthere are no huge explosions , shattering glass or computer-generated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues . \ngrady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career . \nin the world of \" what have you done for me lately ? \" , he knows his second book has to be better than his first . \ninstead of finding out , he drifts , comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood . \nhe doesn\'t have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer ( tobey maguire ) . \njames may be suicidal and psychotic . \ncertainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie . \nhe makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isn\'t interesting enough . \nas the weekend progresses , they are both forced to fully engage life . \nthat\'s the question they must face : comfort or real experiences ? \nthe film takes some interesting chances . \nnon-traditional relationships are presented as matter-of-fact . \nextra-marital , gay , interracial , professor-student : here they aren\'t judged , merely choices . \nthe actors are all first-rate . \ndouglas triumphs , playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled , unshaven and clad in a pink women\'s house robe . \nmaguire\'s disengaged alienation works perfectly here . \nrobert downey jr . as grady\'s agent livens up his scenes . \ndirector curtis hanson ( \" l . a . \nconfidential \" ) makes a few missteps . \nthe women are underused . \nfrances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara , grady\'s married lover but we never understand much of who she is . \nthe chemistry between the two of them is non-existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing . \nkatie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor , but her character goes nowhere . \nwe never even see grady\'s exiting wife . \nthis is very much a guy\'s film . \nthe varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others . \ngrady\'s alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film , not him and sara . \nas the boomers age , expect to see more mid-life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic . \neventually it\'ll probably become cliche , but right now we\'ve got a winner . \ni\'ll finish this in a second . \nright now i have to grab some paint . \ni noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touch-up . \n ( michael redman has written this column for so long that he\'s made mid-life crisis a career choice . ) \n'~pos
' \" love to kill \" starts off aimlessly and gets progressively less coherent as time passes . \nat the outset , the movie appears to be about tony danza , who\'s an illegal distributor of guns , trying to establish a relationship with an unsuspecting woman . \ndanza sets up a double date with her , her sister , and a collegue of his . \neverything seems to be going well , until the sister accidentally dies by falling down a set of stairs . \nmuch confusion and mahem ensues , as the death is covered up and other associates of danza\'s begin to emerge , all after one thing or another . \nsound confusing ? \nit is . \ni think what the filmmakers were trying to do is take the standard crime movie and throw in a little humour and levity . \nin some respects , it works . \nbut the majority of the film is a convoluted and confusing mess . \ncharacters keep popping up with no explanation , demanding money for deals that occur off-screen . \nthe only aspect of the movie that actually works is the budding relationship between danza and the dead woman\'s sister . \nbut so little time is devoted to this part of the story , we never really become too familiar with these characters , and because of this , we don\'t really care what happens to them . \nwell , i didn\'t , at least . \none thing i will give the movie is that it\'s a complete departure for tony danza . \nhere\'s a guy , because of his many sitcom roles , who\'s ingrained in the consciousness as a nice guy who always does the right thing . \nhere , he plays a man who\'s just looking out for himself , and if that means he needs to kill in order to save his own skin , so be it . \ni was very impressed by his performance , and within minutes of the start of the film , i had forgotten all about his good-guy persona . \nmichael madsen is also good as an associate of danza\'s who spends half the movie buddying up to him and the other half trying to kill him . \nlike i said , it\'s not exactly a linear storyline . \n \" love to kill \" should be praised for trying to do something different with the well worn crime genre , but it\'s just too bad that the story doesn\'t really add up to much . \nthe stars deserved better , and so did the audience . \n'~neg
'meet joe black ( reviewed on nov . 27/98 ) \nstarring brad pitt , anthony hopkins , claire forlani \nin \" meet joe black \" , brad pitt plays death . \nthat\'s all that really needs to be said , but nevertheless , i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description . \ndeath decides to take a holiday , what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all , and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what it\'s like to be human . \ndeath assumes the body of brad pitt , and from there , much trouble ensues . \nfor one thing , death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter , played by claire forlani . \nobviously this enrages hopkins , because really , what can death offer ? \nbesides eternal damnation , of course . \nthere is also a sub-plot about forlani\'s ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company . \n \" meet joe black \" runs just under three hours . \ni\'ve always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics . \n \" meet joe black \" is neither historical nor is it an epic , though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be . \nevery single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long . \nand the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should . \na severe editing job could have made this movie excellent , instead of just good , which is what it is . \npitt , an actor i normally loathe , is actually quite engaging as death . \ni believed his performance , and i could see why forlani\'s character would fall in love with him . \ni have to agree with roger ebert , though , who found it hard to believe that an entity that\'s been around for all time wouldn\'t know what peanut butter was . \nthat has nothing to do with pitt\'s performance , of course , but it is a little distracting . \nhopkins gives his usual excellent performance . \nhe\'s able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left , without making him an obnoxious whiner . \nand in her first major studio role , claire forlani is surprisingly good . \nshe has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her . \nso , \" meet joe black \" is a good movie hampered by it\'s ridiculous running time . \nhad the film been cut by an hour or so , i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review . \n'~pos

'call it touched by a demon . \ngregory hoblit\'s fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual , horrific twist . \nif marketed properly , this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim , dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven . \nin fact , there\'s even a little twin peaks to be found here , albeit with the lion\'s share of the weirdness distilled out . \n ( remember bob ? ) \nthe biggest failing of fallen is that , although it\'s consistently interesting , it\'s not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope . \na serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia , but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington ) , the noblest man on the police force , has brought him to justice . \nnow , during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber , the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes , \" what goes around really goes around . \" \nshortly thereafter , he begins to sing \" time is on my side \" as he\'s taken on his last walk . \nminutes later , the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead . \nbut for hobbes , the nightmare is just beginning , because reese wasn\'t a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel . \nand , with reese\'s death , azazel is free to hop from body to body , murdering and wreaking havoc at will . \nonly hobbes and a pretty , female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what they\'re up against . \nthe rest of the cops , including hobbes\' partner , jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini ) , a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland ) , don\'t have a clue , and , as a result , they are in mortal danger . \nas depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel , philadelphia is a dark , dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one . \nno skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown . \nthe most famous landmark to appear isn\'t the liberty bell or independence hall ; it\'s geno\'s steaks . \nshadows and night scenes abound . \nthe days are cloudy and unpromising . \nthis is the kind of setting where it\'s easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men . \nfallen\'s plot is brimming with potential , not all of which is realized . \nsomehow , i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise . \nbut the level of terror , like that of gore , is kept in check . \nnevertheless , there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks . \nthe film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual . \nof the several dozen actors to play azazel , the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica , crash ) , who , despite only being on screen for about ten minutes , gives a fantastically charged performance . \njohn goodman also seems to be enjoying himself , although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick . \nsadly , however , these two are the only ones who excel . \neveryone else , including denzel washington , is boring . \nwashington\'s flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film . \nit\'s not that he\'s bad per se , but he\'s not very interesting . \nthere\'s no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character , and that keeps us distanced , however slightly , from hobbes . \nas circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop , and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate , i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was . \nwashington\'s subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency . \nhowever , at least washington was believable , which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindler\'s list ) and donald sutherland . \nto be fair , the flaws in their characters aren\'t all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written . \nthat said , however , there\'s nothing inspired about either davidtz\'s or sutherland\'s work . \nboth appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts , as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual . \nnarratively , fallen has a few glaring weaknesses . \nalthough the plot proceeds with a convoluted , game-like structure , it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters . \nat times , this is actually helpful , and it has a use beyond the obvious , but there are occasions when ponderous lines like \" i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself \" become a little hard to swallow . \nin addition , fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland , generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel . \nhowever , despite the negatives , i\'m still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending , which i loved . \nthe final scenes are startling , audacious , and unexpected . \nit\'s not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did . \nat a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes , fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself . \nthis is not a great motion picture , but , considering how bad most january releases are , it\'s a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours . \nand , whatever you do , don\'t walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll . \n'~pos
'warning : spoilers are included in this review . . . \nbut it doesn\'t really make much of a difference . \ndeep impact begins the official summer movie season , and it also brings back memories of 1997 . \nremember when dante\'s peak came out in february ? \na few months later , volcano was released . \nthe first film was smart , exhilirating , and one of the best disaster films i had ever seen . \nthe latter film was an incohesive mess that defied logic and wasted talent . \nwell , it\'s deja vu all over again as two disaster films go head to head in competition . \nthis time , unfortunately , the first comet flick is so bad that people may shy away from armageddon , the upcoming comet-disaster to be released the beginning of july . \nof course , the general reaction of the audience was oppposed to mine , and so i am in the minority , as i was when i stood on the side of dante\'s peak . \nbut while watching deep impact , i began to wonder how anyone in their right mind could actually like this film . \napparently many did , and it utterly baffles me . \nto be completely honest , i haven\'t had this little fun watching a disaster film in my entire life . \nvolcano had implausibilities up the wazoo , but it was still rather fun to watch . \ndeep impact doesn\'t just have implausibilities , it also contains cheap human drama , incredibly horrible special effects , and a poorly constructed plot . \nthe only thing that gives it a half star above my bottom ranking is a slightly entertaining final fifteen minutes and some good actors making the most of their characters . \ndeep impact begins in an unnamed year ( the year varies ; advanced technology sets it in the future , but fire in the sky is showing on a local movie theater , pushing it back to 1993 ) . \na line of students is outside at night , peering through telescopes at the dark sky above . \namong these are leo biederman ( elijah wood ) and sarah hotchner ( leelee sobieski ) . \nleo unknowingly discovers a comet , and his teacher sends a photo of the unknown object to an astronomer , who then is able to determine the correct path of this distant comet in about a few seconds . \nhe races off to mail the information , but is killed in a reckless car accident . \na year passes , and nothing is heard about it again . \nwe are then introduced to jenny lerner ( t ? a leoni ) , a reporter for msnbc . \nshe gets handed a job to investigate a possible cover-up in the government involving senator alan rittenhouse ( james cromwell ) . \nshe talks to a woman who mentions that rittenhouse was having an affair with a girl named ellie . \nafter talking with rittenhouse , and unsatisfied with the information she gets , she decides to use the internet for help . \nluckily , she knows exactly how to spell the certain \" ellie \" that she is looking for ( they spell it ele in the film . . . \nthat girl is pretty darn smart for guessing how it was spelled ) . \nbefore she can use the information , the government decides to push her car off the road . \nthey take her in to meet the president of the united states , president beck ( morgan freeman ) . \nbeck recommends that jenny keep the information secret for 48 hours so they can confirm it and then hold a press conference . \nnaturally , she wants to be compensated , and they offer her a front row seat and the chance for the first question . \nand so , yada yada yada , they reveal the comet to the public and their plans : send a massive spacecraft out to destroy it before it can arrive . \nthey announce a plan called \" ark , \" which is their only hope for survival . \na computer will select 800 , 000 people at random . \nthese people are the ones who will go into a large cave underground so that the impact of the comet won\'t kill off the entire human race . \nafter two years , the dust will settle ( actually , it would take much , much longer--approximately ninety years , from what i understand ) and the humans could come back to the surface and start over . \nthe rest of the plot is your standard disaster film procedures , but there is one subplot worth mentioning . \njenny and her father , jason ( maximilian schell ) , have a very touching relationship that forms out of the impending doom . \nthe final moment involving the two characters is heartfelt and emotional . \nit\'s a shame that nothing else is heartfelt . \nnow , of course , we all know that the comet does impact the surface . \nthe title alone suggests it , and the previews actually show it ! \nby doing this , absoltuely no tension can be drawn from any attempt to stop the comet because we all know that it won\'t work . \ndirector mimi leder came from her successful tries at direction with episodes of the hit television show \" er . \" \nher major film debut was the peacemaker , a pathetic and heartless action film . \nwell , this time leder outdid herself , creating a film worse than that one . \nsuggestion to ms . leder : please , stay away from the big screen , or at least the action genre . \nmuch of the blame can be placed on leder directly , because the pace is disastrously off . \nthroughout the film we are given subtitles that tell us how much time has passed ( it goes from months to weeks to hours ) . \nit literally feels like this lapsed time is taking place in real-time--it\'s that boring . \nof course , leder isn\'t all to blame for it . \nscreenwriters michael tolkin and bruce joel rubin have crafted a simplistic story that only gets worse with time . \nwhat starts out promising soon turns deadly ( for the audience anyway ) . \nchock full of cheesy one liners ( \" you know , you are going to have more sex than anyone else in school ! \" ) \nand stupid characters , you might think we were back in the 70s again . \nonly one of the subplots is remotely interesting , while the rest are forgettable and boring . \nand the main plot is so outrageous that you can\'t figure out if this film is supposed to be an action , drama , or sci-fi . \nto put it simply : the special effects of this film are a hit and miss situation . \nthat\'s right , 80\% miss , and 20\% hit . \nscenes above the earth are well done , and the orbiting ship is majestic . \nbut the comet is a huge mistake , making it more laughable than frightening . \nthe concept of even trying to land on a comet is preposterous enough , but that\'s forgiveable . \nwhat isn\'t forgiveable is actually having humans walk on the surface . \ngive me a break , will ya ? \nand of course , the much hyped collision of comet and earth . \nwell , it is far from spectacular , and it makes independence day look brilliant . \nthe water rushing towards the land is effective , but once it hits the continent , the effects turn ridiculous . \ncgi water is used , and it looks so bad that i heard more laughs from the audience than shrieks . \nin fact , i may even recommend the film for those who want to see how bad effects can actually get these days . \njust when we think visual effects can\'t be improved , along comes a film to show that they really can and should be . \none thing has struck a wrong note with me concerning mimi leder\'s direction , which also influences the actors . \nleder loves to show the actors\' faces before and during moments of terror . \nthis reminded me of another action director , renny harlin ( die hard 2 , cliffhanger ) . \nbut harlin succeeds because he shows the faces of the victims in realistic situations . \nleder likes to flaunt people\'s fears via their faces , but instead of coming off as sympathetic , leder seems more of a sadist . \none moment has an astronaut flying off into space . \nthis should be enough to warrant a response from the audience , but leder wants to go farther and shows us the person\'s face while drifting into space . \nthis is one of the cheapest ways to ellicit an emotional response from an audience , and i , for one , am not going to be fooled . \non another note , leder\'s film only picks up its pace during the last fifteen minutes when the comet actually impacts . \nthe pace does pick up , and some very emotional moments are shown . \nthen again , when you watch people cry for their loved ones , it\'s obvious it will be emotional . \nit\'s mostly just a big trick to rope viewers into \" feeling \" for the characters , but it didn\'t work for me . \nbut anyway , the actors do as much as they can with what they are given . \nt ? a leoni ( bad boys , tv\'s \" the naked truth \" ) is the best of the film , and she is given the meatiest role . \nher character is made stronger by leoni\'s presence , and we grow to care for her . \nrobert duvall is energetic and fun to watch , but his character is turned into shreds by the plot . \nelijah wood also comes off rather successfully , but he still hasn\'t had many good roles ( wood , stick to drama ! \nyou are too talented for this stuff ) . \nvanessa redgrave is barely acknowledgeable , and her performance is only enhanced by her strong presence on screen . \nmaximilian schell is distracting , but he does provide some nice humor . \nmorgan freeman has been infinitely better than this , and gives one of his most shallow performances to date ( which is quite remarkable for him ) . \nleelee sobieski could have been better , but i think she just suffered from a poorly written character . \na special note should go to ron eldard and denise crosby . \neldard is good in his role , but is limited by the plot . \ncrosby is special to me personally because she was tasha yar from tv\'s \" star trek : the next generation . \" \nseeing her was one of the highlights of the film . \noverall , a very talented cast virtually wasted . \ndeep impact is rated pg-13 for disaster related elements and brief language . \nthis is one of the worst films of the year , and if it is any omen of things to come , this summer could be one of the worst ever . \nluckily , the x-files movie is coming up , and hopefully armageddon will be more successful . \nit\'s a shame that this film will do so successfully because it just isn\'t worth much . \ncosting nearly $75 million , with special effects done by the illustrious ilm ( which is a huge shocker ) , and with a score composed by oscar-winner james horner ( titanic ) , one might have expected this to be more fun to witness and experience . \nwell , it\'s not . \nwhen the comet does hit the earth , you almost wish it could just take this film along with it . \n'~neg
'james l . brooks , one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news , returns to the big screen with this entertaining , if slightly flawed comedy . \nnicholson plays melvin udall , probably the most horrible person ever on the screen . \nhe\'s racist , homophobic , and never has a good word to say to anyone . \nso , nobody talks to him , except waitress carol conelly ( t . v \nsitcom star hunt , who was last seen in twister , 1996 ) . \nnaturally , udall , conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates , all hit it off in the end . \nlike good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 ) , even though the outcome is completely obvious , as good as it gets is an enjoyable , funny and warm comedy . \nnicholson is hilarious as melvin , churning out insults with superb relish . \nonly nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers . \nhunt is also good as waitress carol , and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson . \nthere\'s also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them . \nkinnear , as the gay neighbor , seems to have a slightly underwritten role , he\'s more of a plot convience than a character . \nalthough his performance is good , his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together . \nin fact , the scene stealer is simon\'s dog , who is funnier than nicholson . \nbut then again , pets are always cute on screen . \nproviding solid support is cuba gooding , jnr ( jerry maguire , 1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isn\'t as good as is character in maguire , he is still fun . \nhe overacts a little , but not so much as to be annoying . \nsmith is also good , although she has a fairly small role . \neven director lawrence kasdan ( body heat , 1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor . \nbut this is primarily nicholsons film , and every scene he\'s in , he\'s steals it . \nhe\'s character is so hateful , though , it\'s amazing that anyone talks to him at all , especially carol . \nand this is the films main problem . \nit\'s totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin . \nshe doesn\'t fall in love with him naturally , the film forces her to fall in love with him . \nalso , melvins character seems to go too nice , too quickly . \ni would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice , loving person . \nit would take a helluva long time , much longer than this film would like to make out . \nbrooks direction is good , though , if a bit average , but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience . \nhe handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally he\'s good . \nthere\'s also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer . \nbut , generally , as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do , which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie . \nthe movie is a bit overlong , but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly . \noverall , as good as it gets is a fun movie , even though it may be unbelivable , and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . ) \nnot quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke ) , but still good fun . \n'~pos
'my first press screening of 1998 and already i\'ve gotten a prime candidate for my worst ten of the year list . \nwhat an auspicious beginning ! \nwelcome to the dog days of winter when the only film openings of merit are those oscar contenders that the studios opened in late december in new york and l . a . and which are just now beginning to appear elsewhere . \nfirestorm , the directorial debut of dances with wolves\'s academy award winning cinematographer dean semler , is the first of the new year\'s crop of movies . \nas our story opens , the movie pretentiously informs us that of the tens of thousands of firefighters only 400 are \" smokejumpers . \" \nwe then cut to a plane load of smoke jumping cowboys and one cowgirl , where one of the gung-ho guys is taking a romance quiz from \" cosmopolitan . \" \nhaving the time of their lives , they then jump into the middle of a burning forest . \nwhen , even in the beginning , the director can\'t get the small parts right , you can sense the movie is in trouble . \nwith the noisy fire roaring all about them and with the trapped people huddled near their gasoline-filled cars , smokejumper monica ( christianne hirt ) tells them to get away from their soon-to-explode vehicles . \nnot bothering to shout nor even get close to them , she announces her warning without raising her voice much or approaching the people . \nmiraculously , they manage to hear her and move away . \nin a movie that specializes in cheap shots , the camera locates the proverbial young girl trapped in a nearby burning building . \nas it does throughout , overly dramatic cinematographer stephen f . windon from the postman uses extremely fast zooms right down to the endangered girl\'s face . \nour show\'s two heroes , the crew\'s chief , wynt perkins , played laconically by scott glenn , and his second-in-command , jesse graves , played by howie long in a weak attempt to be the next steven seagal , enter the burning house looking for the little girl . \nin a panic they have difficulty in locating her before they are engulfed in flames . \nthe manipulative script has her hidden in her own dollhouse . \nthis mawkish show cuts back to monica , who has a life-or-death decision to make . \nthe chopper with the fire-retardant chemicals has only enough to save one group . \nwill it be the large group near the cars or the helpless little girl and monica\'s two firefighting buddies ? \nshe has only seconds to decide who will be saved . \nyes , she goes for the majority , but , miracle of miracles , the other three come out alive anyway . \nnot content with a traditional firefighting story , chris soth\'s screenplay attempts to jazz it up by having william forsythe from palookaville play a vicious killer named randy earl shaye who sets a forest fire so that he can join the crew to put it out and then escape . \n ( \" hoods in the woods , \" is what the \" ground-pounders \" yell out when the convicts are bused in to help them fight the fire . ) \nalong the way , shaye picks up an ornithologist hostage played by suzy amis , who turns out to have been trained in warrior ways by her father , who was a marine drill instructor . \nmost of the highly predictable movie is a long chase in which poor howie long is given one ridiculous stunt after another to look silly performing . \nhe flings a chain saw backwards over his head while riding a speeding motorcycle so that the saw can hit the windshield of the pursuing truck . \narguably the low point is when he escapes from a locked burning building by riding a motorcycle conveniently parked inside . \nusing a ramp , he shoots straight out of the top of the building\'s attic , and when he hits the ground , he just rides off in a cloud of dust . \nwhen the film isn\'t using some stock footage of actual forest fires , the simulated ones look hokey . \neditor jack hofstra cheapens the action even more by his use of burning flames in scene transitions . \nthe ending , with its sick twists , manages to be even worse than the rest of the movie . \nperhaps the best that can be said for the picture is the faint praise i heard afterwards in the lobby , \" it\'s not as bad as some of the television sitcoms . \" \nfirestorm runs mercifully just 1 : 29 . \nit is rated r for violence and language and would be acceptable for teenagers . \n'~neg
'after a stylistic detour with mrs . \nparker and the vicious circle ( which , despite its uncomfortable tone , was close to being a conventional movie ) , director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow , a romantic black comedy about love , betrayal , and self-absorption . \nwhile these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture , rudolph\'s atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing , if not always pleasant , movie . \nit is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it . \nuntil mrs . \nparker , i had not been overly impressed by his movies . \ni found equinox , his last pre- mrs . \nparker effort , to be irritating and frustrating . \ni was somewhat surprised , therefore , to discover that i liked afterglow . \nthere are several reasons for this , but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident , mannered aspects of his approach . \nthe characters here are more like real people with genuine problems , the story is absorbing , and the acting is top-notch . \nin short , rudolph has created a world that it\'s worth spending two hours in . \nafterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples . \njeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold , seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife , marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) . \nfor her part , marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level . \nall she\'s interested in is seducing him during those few days when she\'s ovulating . \nafter he refuses to make love , she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor . \nthe other couple , lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie ) , are an older pair , but they\'re no more content than jeffrey and marianne . \na mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart . \nthey remain married as a matter of convenience , but , since phyllis won\'t allow lucky to touch her , they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs . \nthe landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable . \nthe four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey . \nthe two of them are immediately attracted to one another , and it doesn\'t take long before they\'re lounging together , naked , in her pool . \nmeanwhile , jeffrey , who is captivated by older women , runs into phyllis in a hotel bar , is smitten , and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains . \nthe romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love . \nsex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey , it\'s an unpleasant chore , a loss of control ; to marianne , it\'s a means to a maternal end ; to lucky , it\'s an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis , it\'s a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness . \nultimately , none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves . \nthe greatest strength of the film lies not in the script , but in the performances . \njonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish , callous , suit-and-tie businessman . \nthose who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity . \nlara flynn boyle , who wasn\'t impressive in rudolph\'s equinox , is greatly improved , making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability . \nnick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky , and he manages to deliver some of rudolph\'s most pregnant lines with practiced ease . \nthe clear standout , however , is julie christie , who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis . \nher often wry , occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the film\'s humor , and there\'s hardly ever a moment when she doesn\'t steal the spotlight from her co-stars . \ni don\'t know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors , but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the director\'s earlier productions . \nenough of his trademark style remains , however , to reassure his supporters . \nafterglow is basically a four-pronged character study . \nthe plot is not especially compelling , but the character interaction is , and that\'s the real reason to see this motion picture . \nrudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction . \n'~pos
'ever since wargames , the first real computer hacking movie , hollywood has attempted to produce more and more films about hacking . \nthese films usually show the audience a look into computers that really is not impossible and is usually ridiculous . \nif it\'s not this , the exaggeration about what is real is usually greater than you would expect . \nhackers is guilty of all of these crimes . \nto anyone familiar with computers and/or the internet , most of the movie is so incredibly stupid that you can\'t take it anymore . \nthose of you who frequent one of the greatest sites on the world wide web , the internet movie database , are probably aware of the section for movies entitled \" goofs \" . \nthis is the section for mistakes in the movies . \nwell , imdb sums up hackers extremely well with the first goof listed : \" generally ill-informed and ridiculous to the extreme regarding the capabilities of computers and technology \" . \nand truthfully , this is one-hundred percent correct . \nthe plot , obviously , centers around computer hacking . \nmore specifically , it follows the exploits of dade murphy , a young computer hacker played by jonny lee miller . \nmiller should be extremely thankful for the film trainspotting , because if it were not for that , who knows where his career would be now after hackers . \nthe film opens with a young dade murphy being arrested for hacking computer systems . \nhe was forbidden to use a computer until he turned eighteen years old . \nthe film then picks up at that point , an eighteen year old dade murphy hacking away at the computer . \ndade later meets up with fellow hackers acid burn ( angelina jolie ) , cereal killer ( matthew lillard ) , lord nikon ( laurence mason ) , and the phantom phreak ( renoly santiago ) , who are basically trying to do what is next to impossible : hack the gibson computer and not get caught by the fbi . \noh , and as a little sub-plot , dade also tries to woo acid burn , the only female hacker in the film . \nreally , i can\'t think of much more to say about the film\'s plot aside from what i\'ve said . \nit\'s just a bunch of computer geeks ( no , obsessive compulsive computer geeks a little too advanced for reality ) running around hacking computers and staying away from the fbi . \nthanks to this movie , the public unfamiliar with computers now has a distorted viewpoint of computers and what they can do . \nthis movie makes computers look a little bit too advanced for their time , and the frivolous suggestions it makes are too many to list . \nto sum it up , hackers is a terrible computer film . \nif you\'re looking for a film about computers closer to what goes on in the real world , i suggest sneakers . \nalthough at times it too may seem a little far fetched , it should be much more believable than hackers to regular computer users . \nhopefully , this film didn\'t influence too many young computer users out to think they can do what is portrayed in this 105 minute waste of time . \n'~neg
' \" the fugitive \" is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made . \nit takes realistic , believable characters and tells an exciting story that\'s totally believable throughout . \nthis isn\'t an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action , this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly . \nharrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble , a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife . \nthe entire premise of the story revolves around this murder , but is not told in a straightforward manner . \nwe constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimble\'s perspective . \nhints are dropped from various times of the night kimble\'s wife , helen ( sela ward ) was murdered . \nwe don\'t get to see who the killer is until much further into the story . \nin fact , we might even have a little doubt about kimble\'s innocence ourselves . \nthe film doesn\'t spend much time on the details of kimble\'s trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story . \none of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck . \nbut it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated , it is actually suspenseful to watch . \nthis movie is so incredible because it\'s able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable . \ntommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard , a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives . \nfrom the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur . \nkimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other . \nmost of the film deals with richard\'s complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife . \nford does not have a lot of lines here , so it is stuart and twohy\'s script and davis\'s outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is . \njust watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits , disguising himself , and doing his own detective work is very interesting . \nwe know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed , so as he learns more so do we . \nmeanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down . \nat one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues , but richard is just too smart for them . \nhe leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery . \none of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor . \nthere is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) . \nthey are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer , yet they constantly start up small talk with each other , making funny wisecracks and one-liners , but not in any kind of distracting manner . \nthe final act concludes with another terrific chase . \nrichard figures out who the killer is and confronts him , and although we get a typical fight scene , the case is far from solved . \nthe man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along , and we don\'t realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together . \nmaybe the finally scene is a bit much , but it still has a believable atmosphere to it . \nwe\'re so relieved when justice is served . \nit\'s not the plot is that makes \" the fugitive \" great , it\'s all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story . \nwatching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous . \nif only hollywood could produce more movies like this . \n ( 10/31/96 ) ( 1/29/97 ) ( 6/13/97 ) [see also : \" nick of time \" ] \n'~pos
'if there\'s one thing i just can\'t stand , it\'s a film that oozes with sentimentality . \nhere\'s a note to all film makers : films are more effective when the emotions of the characters speak for themselves . \nswelling , saddening music is not a good way to tell us that the people in the film are unhappy , and that the situation is hopeless . \nalas , my giant is a film that uses manipulative sentimentality so frequently and with such high intensity that i forgot as i watched it that there are other ways of getting audience members choked up . \nwhat reminded me was that i wasn\'t choked up , or even the slightest bit moved , for that matter . \nmy giant is a forced , contrived , and conspicuously un-cute ( i detest the word \" cute \" but i\'ve chosen to use it because the makers clearly wanted to create a \" cute \" film here ) . \nit takes a premise that might have been interesting ( i liked the preview ) , and bogs it down with endless plot turns and cliches , all of which are intended to get some kind of easy emotional rise from the audience . \nmaybe it will work for some people . \nit didn\'t work for me . \nbilly crystal plays sam cayman , an agent who , at the beginning of the film , is in romania . \nhe\'s in romania because the kid actor he made famous is doing a film . \nthe screenplay has him in romania so he can get fired , get in a car accident , and get saved by an enormous individual who stands almost eight feet tall . \nhis name is max ( gheorghe muresan ) , and sam thinks he\'d be a great movie star because of his size . \nsubplots are as follows : sam has a son and a wife ( kathleen quinlan ) , and he\'s never around for them , so they move to chicago . \nmax is in love with a woman named lilianna who moved away from romania twenty years before the film begins . \nsam convinces max to go back to america with him so they can make lots of money , and so their various subplots can all be resolved . \nsam is broke . \nmax is dying . \npass the kleenex . \nmy giant , as a comedy , is only moderately funny . \nit has its moments , the best of which features steven seagal making fun of himself . \nin one great scene , sam gets his son on the phone to talk to seagal ; of course , his son doesn\'t believe that he\'s actually speaking to seagal , and he goes off about how bad of an actor he is ( i would quote the line i like but it would probably lose its effect ) . \ncrystal is always entertaining , and he has a few good lines here ( some of which are subtle throwaways that many will miss entirely ) ; often , however , he\'s countered by a slew of jokes that aren\'t funny , and cause an involuntary rolling of the eyes . \nmuresan is kind of fun to watch , but he just can\'t act very well . \nquinlan , on the other hand , is a great actress who needs to get a role that shows off her talents . \nshe was underused last year in both event horizon and breakdown , but at least in those films she had moments in which she could show us her stuff . \nhere , the best thing she gets to do is fake a romanian accent . \nall of these disappointing ingredients create a film that , for much of its running time , is simply mediocre . \nas my giant lumbers to its inevitable conclusion , however , director michael lehmann ( who did a great job directing the underrated hudson hawk ) and scriptwriter david seltzer pile on every cliche imaginable , each one intended specifically to pull at our heartstrings . \nsam\'s multiple engagements with his family are all completely hackneyed ( how about a main character who has a healthy relationship with his family ? ) . \nlater , it turns out the entire story is supposed to be a great big metaphor signifying sam\'s reunion with his family . \nand some people might think that what sam does for max towards the end is a valiant thing , but i had a few morality problems with it ( and i apologize for being vague ) . \nit\'s icky . \nit drips with gooey , wannabe human emotions . \nmy giant could have been a straightforward and funny family film . \nmore importantly , it could have been moving on a level far deeper than it is . \ninstead , it\'s a complicated , overlong , and under-engaging film that elicits too few laughs and strives for superficial tears . \nand since it left me feeling completely unmoved , i stand by my position that sentimentality is evil and will ultimately destroy the world . \n'~neg
'i think that any competent member of the human race who\'s ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer . \neven though i try very hard to not predict films as i\'m watching them ( especially not romantic comedies ) , the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds , and sometimes minutes , before i actually saw it happen on screen . \nbut i don\'t care . \nnot even a little . \nmy reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great . \n2 ) drew barrymore is great . \n3 ) the movie is so funny . \nthere are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard . \ni haven\'t laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers . \nsandler plays robby hart , a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music . \nin the opening scenes , he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer , at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brother\'s wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life , up to that point , was utter pointlessness . \na week later , at his own wedding , he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e , linda ( angela featherstone ) . \nwith his life in complete disarray , he meets julia ( barrymore ) , a waitress . \nshe is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave ) , and is to marry him in about three months . \njulia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans . \nsoon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk , and that robby and julia really love each other . \noh sure , it\'s trite . \nand if anyone making this film expected us to , like , feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer , then they truly underestimated their audience . \nwhat makes the story bearable , aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music , are the performances . \nbarrymore is simply adorable here ( i\'ve never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) . \nnot only is she pleasant to look at , but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesn\'t hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written . \nand the jerk , played in full-force by graves , is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy i\'ve ever seen . \nnaturally , the true star here is sandler . \ni think the guy is flat-out hilarious . \nhe can say something that just isn\'t funny , and his delivery makes me laugh . \nhis comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore , but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can , indeed , hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy . \nwhereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler , the wedding singer gives him a character that , for the first time , he actually has to fit into . \nas far as i\'m concerned he succeeded , and this film is testimony that he does , in fact , have some range in his talents . \nand the movie is just so funny . \nperhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him . \nthis is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air . \nand while the film , like all romantic comedies , takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up , there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half . \nmy formal complaints for the wedding singer aren\'t very important . \nthe film is predicable , but who cares ? \nthe characters are extremely likable , the movie is ridiculously funny , and the experience is simply enjoyable . \nin addition to this , i can\'t imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film . \nin that order , i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review . \ni just want everyone to know that i laughed . \na lot . \n'~pos

'based on the boris karloff\'s classic by the same name , the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris , imhotep , who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up , having his tongue removed , and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles , then entombed . . . all while still alive . \nrecap a few thousand years later , where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother , jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra , in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy . \nproblem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress , using evelyn as a sacrifice . . . \nwalking in with relatively low expectations , i thought this movie was actually pretty good . \nthe visuals and cgi are astounding , and obviously not cheaply done at all . \nthey pack a ton of detail into the images , especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi . \nthe computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes , such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all , those who took his artifacts are cursed ) . \nunfortunately , the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time , becoming a tug of war for control between genres . \non one hand , it is a fast paced action film . \non the other , it\'s a frightening horror film . \nand on the side , it\'s a hilarious comedy . \nideally , for it to be successful , the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect , with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) . \nthe problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief , with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner . \nif they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy , it would have helped if it were established early on in the film , but unfortunately , with the backstory of imhotep\'s entombment , that would be impossible . \nand then there\'s the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies . \nwhile really well done , it had the feel of slapstick comedy . \nreplace the sword with a chainsaw and you\'d effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness . \nwhile entertaining and funny , it feels really out of place . \nbut at least it\'s a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of . \non the whole , the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end , entertaining the audience . \nbut i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn \nthe sound down ! \nwhile a lot of theatres have good sound systems , my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if you\'re not careful ) . \nwhen they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film , \" end of days \" , it was so loud i couldn\'t make anything out . \n'~pos
'based on the 1960s tv series that i had never seen or heard of before this movie ( be happy , i won\'t bore you with any lame and unnecessary comparisons ) , this film allows will smith to take a third stab at the independence day weekend box-office , after scoring huge successes with men in black ( 7/10 ) , directed by the same man who controlled this one , and independence day ( 6/10 ) . \ncan you say . . . the \nthird times not a charm ? \nplot : james west and artemus gordon are chosen by the president to find the man responsible for the kidnapping of the nation\'s top scientists , and threatening to take over the united states within a week . \ncritique : i did not laugh once during this entire picture . \nwhen you consider that this film is a part-comedy , that\'s not a very good sign . \ni also did not tense up or particularly enjoy any of its unenergetic action sequences which provided me with little more than a few minutes time to think back to the lovely salma hayek scenes . \nwhen you consider that the other \" part \" of this film is geared as an action/adventure , i would say that this another negative sign . \nand when you consider that the first hour of the film was boring and a little slow , the story-line tired , reminiscent of swiss cheese and uninvolving , and the special effects interesting but worth very little inside a plot filled with lame one-liners , weak characterizations and an anti-climactic end , you pretty much have the gist of my impression of this \" big \" summer blockbuster . \nit blows . \nor as they say in french , \" eet blows \" . \ncould it be that the script was crappy because it took four people to write it ? \nmaybe . \ncould it be that most of the special effects don\'t show up until the last half hour , and even then , we don\'t see anything that its trailers hadn\'t already given away ? \nperhaps . \nor could it be that we have come to expect so much more from will smith and hollywood big-budget movies , that we cannot help but evaluate them on a scale onto their own ? \nnaaaaaaah ! \na bad movie is a bad movie . \non a positive note , i could honestly say that i did very much enjoy the lovely performance by the adorable salma hayek , who seemed underused ( in my humble opinion ) , and lit up every bubbly scene that she was hardly in . \nbranagh was also fun as the scenery-munching , over-the-top bad guy , but that\'s pretty much where the entertainment-buck stopped . \nsmith and kline were static at best , the plot full of holes , and the score insignificant and derivative of a dozen others . \ni would strongly advise anyone not to see this movie . \nthen again , there is that one scene with the lovely salma hayek tied up in a cage . . . huh . . . oh \nyeah , but the rest of the movie sucked . \nlittle known facts about this film and its stars : will smith has starred in two of the ten all-time top grossing films worldwide : 1997\'s summer blockbuster men in black ( 7/10 ) , for which he also recorded the grammy-winning title song , and 1996\'s independence day ( 6/10 ) . \nhe once turned down a scholarship to mit to pursue his singing career . \nkevin kline is a graduate of the juilliard school of drama , and has been married to the cute-as-a-button actress phoebe cates since 1989 . \nthey have two kids together , greta simone and owen . \none of the buildings that gets blown up in this film has \" kasdan \" written on it . \nlawrence kasdan is a director known to have worked with kevin on five of his movies , including the big chill , silverado , i love you to death , grand canyon and french kiss . \nsalma hayek gave up a successful career as a major television star in latin america and moved to the united states to start over , even though she spoke no english . \nshe made her feature film debut as an actress with a small role in allison anders\' mi vida loca ( no , not the rickie martin video ! ) and played her first starring role in robert rodriguez\'s desperado opposite antonio banderas . \nsince then , she has made an appearance in each one of rodriguez\'s films . \nshe stands 5\'2 \" , was born in southeast mexico , and the daughter of a lebanese father and a mexican mother . \none of the actresses cast as branagh\'s lovely but lethal beauties includes bail ling , a stage and screen star in her native china who was last seen starring opposite dick gere in red corner ( 7/10 ) . \nanother is dutch-born frederique van der wal , who is one of the world\'s most recognized supermodels , having graced the cover of cosmopolitan numerous times , as well as harper\'s bazaar , vogue and mademoiselle . \n'~neg
'on re-watching italian writer/director dario argento\'s much lauded murder mystery tenebrae , i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with . \nin emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles , but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his \" giallo \" murder mysteries . \nwhile it\'s certainly not perfect , repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller . \nthe story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book \" tenebrae \" . \nwith the police on his back for leads , he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems . \nthe film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa . \nhe brings grace , charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him . \nthe film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension . \nargento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral , ambivalent , shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business . \ntenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argento\'s scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here . \nit may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play . \nin that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes . \nneedless to say for argento fans , there is no denying the director\'s brilliance as a stylist . \nmany of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork . \nthey are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light , rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria . \ninstead , tenebrae\'s set design and lighting paints a sleek , clinical , chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world . \nand the soundtrack\'s mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment . \nso tenebrae has much to recommend it , no question . \nstill , constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative . \nsome critics argue that logic doesn\'t matter in argento films , but damnit , it matters in all films to the point where viewers don\'t deserve to feel cheated . \nby the way , if you don\'t want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs . \nabout an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which , properly handled , could have proved ingenious . \nwe witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who , we later discover , is none other than the author peter neal . \nhe is insane , apparently . \nthe murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides it\'s time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife . \nhe is finally revealed to us as this \" second killer \" in the film\'s bloody climax . \nbut argento muffs the twist , both technically and narratively . \nyou see , we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killer\'s house . \nbut thanks to poor editing , its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway . \nbad cutting puts the timing way out . \nin other words , he\'s almost in two places at once . \nduring this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring . \nby the film\'s end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant . \nthe injury ? \nhe banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock ! \nthus , the revelation of the \" hero \" as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking , but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled . \nhelpfully , in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along . \nbut there too is a problem , as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least . \nthe story owes us a better understanding of franciosa\'s mind , his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage . \ntenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies . \nfor instance , a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike . \nwe would assume the rider is the same boy , but it turns out to be some male character we aren\'t even introduced too ! \nthat\'s careless filmmaking , pure and simple . \nwhy , you may ask , do i go on about the story\'s flaws ? \nbecause when it comes to visuals and set pieces , argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world . \ntake one of the extended scenes in tenebrae . \nan upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town . \nfinally , as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine , she accidentally stumbles on the serial killer\'s lair . \nit\'s an absolutely masterful sequence , tense and exciting , and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone . \nand that\'s exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating . \ntoo often , it seems , argento\'s films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts . \nmind you , if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look . \nand if you\'re a fan of argento\'s unique style of giallo thriller then it\'s essential . \nsee the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli . \nit\'s a stylish , great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative . \na shame , because it doesn\'t have to be that way . \ntake argento\'s more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 ) , where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache . \nproof that he can do it , if he tries . . . \n'~pos
'in the line of duty is the critically praised series of television movies dealing with the real-life incidents that claimed lives of law enforcement officers in usa . \nthe twilight murders , another one from the series , is dealing with the case of gordon kahl ( played by rod steiger ) , old farmer from north dakota who would rather spend a year in prison than pay taxes to the despised u . s . government . \nafter being released , he still refuses to pay taxes and the warrant is issued for his arrest . \nwhen the u . s . marshals come to arrest him , it turns out that kahl isn\'t alone . \nmany poor farmers in rural northwest share his extremist anti-government beliefs , and the routine operation turns into shootout that would leave federal officers that . \nthat brings fbi on the scene , and agent mayberly ( michael gross ) is supervising the manhunt . \nhowever , his efforts seem fruitless , since kahl still has many supporters , some of them even in the local law enforcement . \nafter betrayed , 1988 thriller by costa gavras , hollywood mostly ignored the disturbing trends of rising right-wing extremism in the american northwest , and that remained so until oklahoma city bombing , when media hype brought right-wingers back into spotlight . \nuntil that time , only the television movies like this one bothered to pay attention to that phenomenon . \nunfortunately , the twilight murders is still routine and formulaic television film , that uses sensationalist real life content in order to cover lack of originality in the script . \nsometimes , like many american tv movies , it creates drama where drama shouldn\'t be . \non the other hand , film is steadily directed by dick lowry , and rod steiger does good job potraying gordon kahl . \non the other hand , michael gross as his pursuer is quite wooden and his interaction with some of the actors is terrible . \nhowever , film does deal with potentially thought-provoking social and political issues , so hour and half spent in front of the screen shouldn\'t be the total waste of time . \n'~neg
'as any sociologist will attest , your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult . \nparents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives . \nbut if your upbringing is marred with violence , hate and dysfunctionality , then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome . \n`affliction\' explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood . \nthe man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) . \nhere is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface . \nhe is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me . \nbut as you scratch beneath the surface , something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head . \nwe see that he is a mean-tempered person . \nhe has a hard time taking control of his emotions , which usually gets the better of him . \nhe is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person , but something is sparking a tendency towards violence . \nhe also has tremendous problems with relationships . \nhe is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter . \nbut his bearish persona and stature alienates her . \nhe is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him . \nhis demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk . \nshe tries to remain true to him and supportive , but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person , relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point . \nfinally , he is spiteful and vindictive . \nas a rejected father , he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless . \nas the town\'s only police officer , he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died . \nwe can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain . \nhe is a prisoner and a slave to it . \nhe is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension . \nwhat kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ? \nwe learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) . \nthis is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet . \nhe is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist . \nwe see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks . \nto heighten the father\'s churlishness , the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person . \nvery effective . \ntoday , wade\'s dad is quite elderly , but still manages to instill fear into a grown man . \nthe influence that the father possesses is inescapable , and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade . \nthe result is every son\'s nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be . \nthis is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama , and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity . \nhe\'s a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father . \ncoburn displays heft as the bitter dad . \nbut , it\'s most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare . \nthere\'s nothing light or fluffy about this film . \nthat may turn many moviegoers away . \nbut it\'s certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing nolte\'s and coburn\'s raw acting talents . \n'~pos

\nso these are exiles from krypton , which blew up right ? \nwere they living there before krypton exploded ? \nhow do you get to \" inner space \" ? \nthis whole \" inner space \" notion is never explained , particularly in terms of how these people get information from the outside world . \nhow do they know where superman went ? \nhow do they know he took the name clark kent and now works at the daily planet ? \nthese kinds of things frustrate the hell out of me . \nargo city is kept running by a power source called the omegahedron . \none day the founder of argo city , zaltar ( peter o\' toole ) , gives the omegahedron to superman\'s cousin , kara ( helen slater ) , for use as inspiration in her art . \nkara uses it to create a bug-like thing which immediately crashes through the layer of \" whatever \" that protects the city . \nin the chaos , the omegahedron sails out through the opening , dooming the argonians to death . . . \nin three days time , or something . \nkara then climbs into a pod which zaltar had designed for interdimensional travel and chases after the omegahedron to save her world . \nthe power source travels directly to earth and lands in the bowl of dip belonging to a minor-league witch named selena ( faye dunaway ) who , immediately before her dip was ruined , announced her desires to rule the world to her sometimes warlock boyfriend nigel ( peter cook ) . \nselena somehow knows that this ball from the sky will help her with her evil plans , and she sets out to achieve world domination . \nselena is unaware of course that kara has also arrived on earth , and that she\'s arrived as supergirl ( complete with appropriate costume ) . \nsupergirl emerges from the bottom of a lake when she arrives . \nok . . . \nhuh ?

\nlois lane\'s sister , lucy . \nok , coincidence is one thing folks , but we\'re getting really contrived now . \nwhat follows are some generic all-girls school hijinks . . . \ncomplete with evil bully girls ( mean for no reason , of course ) and even a shower scene ( ! ) . \nbest moment though comes when supergirl decides to put a bra on over her school uniform and starts stuffing it with socks . \nat this point i\'m rapidly wondering why i\'m bothering with this nonsense . \nthere is some credit to give to the film however . \none lengthy and elaborate sequence featuring an \" evil \" bulldozer destroying a small town in search of its \" prey \" is very well done . \nalso , its commendable to see genders reversed in the film , whereas the women have all the power and the men are merely objects and tools . \nhart bochner ( die hard ) is particularly fun as kara\'s love interest , a lovesick landscaper who is under a spell cast by selena ( although he is unfortunately part of one of the film\'s more ridiculous moments , when he has to be rescued from being tapped by some \" menacing \" bumper cars ) . \nthen there were numerous little things that bothered me . \nthe flying effects are never convincing for a moment . . . \nit\'s all too obvious that helen slater is hooked to wires . \ninstead of having her look like she\'s flying , the filmmakers wanted her to be \" graceful \" , so she poses a lot and does ballet-type maneuvers . \nalso , who are the first two humans to meet supergirl when she arrives on earth ? \na pair of truck drivers/rapists who immediately attack her and then meet a \" wacky \" demise . \nthere is also some rampant product placement in the film , most notably for popeye\'s , tylenol , and a&w root beer , with the latter actually putting its logo on the t-shirt of one of the rapists ( ? ! ) . \nfinally , just one word : monsters . \nfaye dunaway and peter o\'toole ham it up unmercifully , however when o\'toole overacts he\'s entertaining and when dunaway does it she\'s annoying ( her character actually says the line \" seize them ! \" \nat one point ) . \ndunaway\'s henchmen ( played by peter cook and brenda vaccaro ) fare much better , with vaccaro coming off best as the equivalent of ned beatty\'s otis character from the first two superman movies . \nhelen slater effectively portrays supergirl as the innocent , naive character she\'s written to be , as she\'s able to gaze at flowers and bunnies with the right amount of genuine wonder to make it believable . \nbelievability aside though , it\'s still annoying . \nnow despite all this negativity ( and i\'m not alone here . . . supergirl is not a well liked nor a well respected movie in many circles ) , leave it to the good people at anchor bay entertainment to actually make people not only interested , but excited about its release on dvd ! \nthey have released two separate editions of the film on dvd , to the delight of many people ( including myself . . . \nyet i\'m still unclear as to why , since this movie is so awful ) . \nthe first and most widely available dvd release features the international version of the film which runs 10 minutes longer than the print which ran in u . s . theaters . \nthe movie is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2 . 35 : 1 , is enhanced for 16x9 televisions , and has been remastered in full thx glory . \nextras on the disc include : a full length audio commentary track with director jeannot szwarc and \" special project consultant \" scott michael bosco , the excellent 50-minute documentary from 1984 called supergirl-the making of a feature ( dig that workout montage ! ) , 5 trailers , 3 tv spots , talent bios , in-depth storyboards ( accompanied by score from the movie ) , and assorted still galleries . \nthe transfer on this international version is incredible . . . \nyou\'d think you were watching a new release . \nimages are sharp , colors jump off the screen , and the picture is free of scratches or artifacts . \nonly some special effects sequences show the wear of time , and there just isn\'t much that can be done about that ( unless you\'re obsessive like george lucas ) . \nthe new thx approved audio is loud and clear in all the right places , however you\'ll be hearing absurd dialogue and a mediocre jerry goldsmith score ( which is completely unrelated to john williams\' classic superman theme and sounds better suited for a cannon films\' golan-globus production ) . \nthe commentary track featuring director szwarc and project consultant bosco is a step in the right direction in the evolution of audio commentaries . \nbosco seems to be an expert in all things supergirl and is there with szwarc to ensure that there\'s no dead air on the track . \nbosco probes szwarc for information on virtually everyone and everything that comes onscreen , and we learn a great deal more about the film as a result of his participation . \nalthough , at times you can tell that bosco is looking for a specific response from szwarc , and is surprised when he doesn\'t get that response . \nwe learn some fascinating tidbits on the track , most notably the \" almost \" appearance in the film by christopher reeve . \ngreat detail is given about superman\'s proposed role in the original script before reeve ( wisely ) dropped out . \nas it stands , superman is written off early on in the film when we hear a radio broadcast mention that he is billions of light years away on some sort of peace mission . \nfor the sake of brevity , i won\'t even get into that one . \nszwarc also reveals that is was the conscious decision of the salkinds ( and everyone else agreed ) that supergirl needed to stand on its own , replacing the science fiction of the superman films with cutsy \" whimsical fantasy \" nonsense . \nbosco also points out scenes not in the american release as they come along , claiming that had they been in the original release it would have been a hit at the box office . \nagain , for the sake of brevity , i won\'t even get into that one . \nanchor bay has also released a limited edition ( only 50 , 000 copies pressed ) two-disc set . \ndisc one contains everything mentioned for the regular release . \ndisc two features the never before seen director\'s cut of the film , which runs 138 minutes long . \nthe additions mainly consist of scene extensions which don\'t add much of note , except for a few moments which lengthen peter o\'toole\'s screen time ( particularly during his latter appearances ) . \nthe print is rough in spots and the sound is only in mono , but fans of the film won\'t care . \none question though . . . \nshouldn\'t the director\'s commentary be on the director\'s cut of the film ? \ni\'d never seen supergirl before i sat down to watch this dvd . \ni was nine when it was released to theaters , and even then i was smart enough to inform my parents not to take me to see it . \nso when i popped the dvd into my player and sat down in my easy chair i had no idea what to expect . \ni knew the film wasn\'t beloved and i never had any interest in it before , but i was willing to give it a shot because of the impressive amount of work put into the disc . \nas the disc began to spin i was rather impressed with the opening sequence , which made me sit up and wonder if my assumptions all this time could have been wrong . \ncome to find out however it was just the chase digital stereo logo . . . \nso i slunk back into my seat as the nightmare started . \nat the end of the film , supergirl flies back into the lake with the omegahedron , and flies back to argo city . \nugh , i give up . \ni\'m surprised i even made it to the end of the film not once , not twice , but three times to review these discs . \nsupergirl is definitely a terrific dvd package , but a very lousy movie . \n[pg] \n'~neg
'is evil dead ii a bad movie ? \nit\'s full of terrible acting , pointless violence , and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release . \nexplaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult . \n`well what\'s it about ? \' \n`five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly , hairy , wart covered monsters . \' \n`come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week . \nwhy should i see it again ? \' \n`no evil dead ii is different , it\'s funny . \' \n`it\'s funny to see people die ? \nare you sick or something ? \' \nmaybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie . \nhis unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle , as disturbing as it is hilarious . \nan example of raimi\'s odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ash\'s girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound . \nsure it\'s over-the-top , but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood , staining his face and knocking him back a few feet . \nthe whole movie is like this , watch ash get beat up , watch ash defeat the monster , watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster . \nthe more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets , the more amusing it becomes . \nno matter how sick it may sound , it is funny to watch bruce ampbell\'s ash get his butt kicked every five minutes . \nand raimi takes advantage , he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend , by the body of an old lady , even by his own right hand . \nlike the less superior idle hands , we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part . \nbut it doesn\'t end , ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family . \nall of these events , thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements , at first become shocking , then inexplicably funny . \nraimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses , he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers\' duck soup , then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off . \nwith a running time of less than an hour and a half , raimi gets away with the impossible , making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares . \nending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series , raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldn\'t wait to make it\'s sequel . \n'~pos
' \" practical magic , \" is a film that is so misguided in so many ways that it makes you wonder how such talented and high-profile actors would even get involved in an embarrassing clap-trap like this one . \nthe film stars sandra bullock and nicole kidman as sally and gillian owens , two sisters whose family comes from a long line of witches , spanning back 200 years . \nat the start , their parents die when they are still children , and they go to live with their two zany aunts ( stockard channing and dianne wiest ) . \nswitch to the present day , gillian , who is the stronger , more rebellious sibling , leaves home , and meets up with a dark , abusive guy ( goran visjnic ) , while sally stays in their hometown , meets and falls in love with a sweet , caring man , has two children , and then is devastated when her husband is hit by a truck and killed ( come to think of it , she\'s not too devastated since she gets over it in about two minutes ) . \nwhen gillian calls sally to come get her after having another abusive spat with visjnic , they accidentally murder him , and in desperation , bury the body in the backyard of their aunts\' house . \nadd to this wildly convoluted story subplots involving the dead rising and an exorcism , not to mention a spattering of \" light-hearted whimsy , \" and you have a pretty good idea how messy \" practical magic \" is . \nafter seeing the film , i reflected that there was not even one scene , or element , that i liked or enjoyed . \nit is a comedy , to be sure , but all of the humor falls astoundingly flat , and the occasional dramatic moments are the least bit touching . \nit is not charming or entertaining in any way . \nand then to top it off , we\'ve got this dark , but bird-brained story of an evil spirit taking over gillian\'s body . \nwhatever . \nthe characters are handled terribly , and actually , most of the actors do not have the fortune of even getting to be what you could call a character . \nthere is no reason why channing and wiest should have decided to be in this film , and in every scene involving them , they are always standing side-by-side . \nno attempt is made to flesh them out into actual people . \nthe same goes for aidan quinn , as a handsome police investigator , who has the misfortune of being the romantic lead opposite bullock , even though he comes into it at around the 70-minute mark , and once again , there is no attempt to develop their relationship , or his character , in any way . \nin fact , every line of dialogue in the film is in service of moving the plot along , rather than getting to know the people saying the lines . \ni should have know i was headed for trouble during the opening credits , when i found out the screenplay was written by the deeply hated akiva goldsman , who managed to destroy the \" batman \" series with \" batman forever \" and \" batman and robin . \" \n \" practical magic \" is directed by griffin dunne , primarily an actor , who last year made the contrived , clumsy romance , \" addicted to love , \" with meg ryan and matthew broderick . \ni disliked that movie quite a bit , but since \" practical magic \" is even worse , that can only give you a taste of what a talentless filmmaker he is . \ni\'d tell him to quit while he\'s ahead , but in these last two years , he\'s ultimately already buried himself . \n'~neg

'nearly every film tim burton has directed has been an homage to the horror genre -- \" frankenweenie , \" \" beetlejuice , \" \" batman , \" \" edward scissorhands , \" \" ed wood , \" \" mars attacks ! \" \n-- yet none of them have been horror films . \n \" sleepy hollow \" is his first attempt to actually scare people . \ni greeted the prospect with high anticipation ; burton\'s whole career seemed to be leading up to this . \ni left disappointed . \nandrew kevin walker\'s screenplay takes only the character names from the classic short story \" the legend of sleepy hollow . \" \nin the movie ichabod crane ( johnny depp ) is a new york city police constable who is trying to introduce scientific methods of investigation to his superiors . \nichabod is dispatched to the small town of sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders . \nseveral of the town\'s leading citizens have been decapitated by the headless horseman . \nalthough he rejects the ghost story the town elders tell him , ichabod finds that the facts of the case confound his scientific reasoning . \nhe also discovers that the killings are not random , that the victims are tied together by a secret . \nalong the way ichabod gets help from a bewitching ( literally ) young woman ( christina ricci ) and the son of one of the murder victims ( marc pickering ) . \nmy reaction : ho-hum . \nthe plot is an accumulation of cliches without even the slightest touch of originality to make it interesting . \nthat in itself is forgivable ; hollywood constantly tries to sell us used products in new packages . \nhowever , burton\'s attempts at inducing fright come off as goofy . \nit might be his background -- in his previous movies , goofy was the goal . \nalong the same lines , it doesn\'t help that creature designer ( and producer ) kevin yagher has done his best work for the tongue-in-cheek tales from the crypt tv series . \na witch\'s eyes and tongue shoot out like roger rabbit\'s , a tree spurts blood like it\'s in a monty python sketch , and the headless horseman . \n . \n . \nwell , he\'s a guy without a head . \n . \n . \non a horse ( boo ! ) . \nthe performances are also awful . \nalthough he\'s impressed me with his work in other films , depp doesn\'t seem to know what to do with ichabod , and his dialogue is hampered by stilted diction that\'s supposed to pass for an 18th century accent . \nricci seems to put all her effort into seeming enigmatic , which guarantees that we won\'t sympathize with her character . \nthe actor who is revealed at the end to be the villain comes off as ridiculously cartoonish . \nthe only pleasure generated by the cast comes from surprise cameos by christopher lee , martin landau , and christopher walken . \ni wonder if this movie was originally conceived as part of francis ford coppola\'s projected series of gothic adaptations , a series that produced only \" bram stoker\'s dracula \" and \" mary shelley\'s frankenstein . \" \ncoppola is an executive producer for \" sleepy hollow , \" and the script reflects his interest in early forms of \" moving pictures , \" particularly in a toy that ichabod carries which blends two pictures to create an optical illusion . \n ( there\'s a bird on one side of the card , a cage on the other . \nwhen the card is flipped rapidly , the bird appears to be caged . ) \nbottom line : the hollow isn\'t the only thing that\'s sleepy . \n'~neg
'not since oliver stone\'s natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary , and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility . \nwhile fincher\'s films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples ) , fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997\'s the game ) into something like a definitive statement . \njack ( norton , acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone , whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia . \non the offhand advice of a doctor , he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer . \nhere he meets bob ( marvin lee aday , aka meat loaf ) , a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia . \nstrangely , the release he finds while sobbing on bob\'s breasts allows him to sleep at night , at least until a fellow group-therapy \" tourist \" named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him , forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity . \nlater , he meets tyler durden ( pitt ) , a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life . \none night , after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( don\'t ask-- you\'ll just have to see the movie , awright ? ) , he is goaded by tyler into a fight , and damned if it doesn\'t feel good . \nit is pure , raw existence , a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison . \nhe moves into tyler\'s squalid abandoned mansion , and they form the titular organization , an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules , the first two of which are \" don\'t talk about fight club . \" \narmed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy , tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees . \nresentment creeps into jack\'s heart , made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla . \nfunded by a frivolous lawsuit , tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem . \ntheir initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition , and jack fears that things have gone sour . \nit is after this point , when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original , that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist . \nit is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting . \nit\'s a major ( though not fatal ) flaw , and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher , it feels like a cop-out . \nfight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people . \nin the early going , it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul , and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it . \ni\'ll be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs don\'t spring up here and there , and i\'ll be even more amazed if fincher isn\'t vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone . \nthey needn\'t bother , because fight club is less a message movie than fincher\'s elaborate attempt at a joke . \ntyler durden , for all his dionysian allure , is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization . \nin this context , the joke works , but like the latest columbine joke , some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh , and others won\'t . \nhopefully , though , their silly moral outrage won\'t spoil the joke for the rest of us . \n'~pos

'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \ni was incredulous when i first heard that mgm was planning a sequel to their 1995 science-fiction flick species . \nsquandering an intriguing premise , the original film turned out to be a dreadful mess , widely disliked by both audiences and critics alike -- and nonetheless still somehow succeeded in becoming a financial success , raking in over $60 million domestic during the competitive summer season despite a distinct lack of star power in its cast ( ben kingsley\'s a splendid actor , but a marquee name he ain\'t ) . \nmiraculously dodging the bullet with the first film , i doubted that they\'d dare tempt fate and go for another round . \nso here comes species ii , with a new creative team ( director peter medak and screenwriter chris brancato step in for roger donaldson and dennis feldman , respectively ) that fails to improve the series one iota -- like its predecessor , species ii fails to capitalize on a potentially promising kernel and instead runs the gamut from ridiculously silly to unmitigatedly stupid . \nthe film follows the exploits of a young man , patrick ross ( justin lazard ) , whose sole focus is on cruising along the streets in order to pick up women , loitering in strip clubs , and generally trying to bed as many different ladies as he possibly can . \nin other words , patrick is like a lot of guys ; these activities could describe the everyday routines of a huge percentage of men his age , but there\'s a catch -- he\'s an astronaut who recently returned from a seemingly successful mission to mars , and who\'s now infected with alien dna . \npatrick\'s overriding compulsion : to mate and sire countless numbers of gooey little alien offspring . \nand when he becomes aware of eve ( natasha henstridge ) , a half-human , half-alien clone of the monster from the first film being studied in a government lab , patrick\'s primary focus turns to her -- \" if these two were to mate , the resulting pure strain of offspring would be unstoppable \" warns dr . laura baker ( marg helgenberger , gamely reprising her role ) with admirable conviction . \nspecies ii opens with the mars mission , and the space scenes are remarkably unconvincing and hokey-looking , even splicing back to dated , grainy footage of actual spacecraft activities -- they really skimped on production values this time around . \nhowever , this all looks positively inspired when compared to the first appearance of the evil alien goo which ultimately infests patrick ; watching as it slinks around the command module of the spaceship , any question as to whether or not this is a cheesy b-movie is quickly answered . \nmr . brancato\'s original screenplay is filled with outrageous lines which often leaves the audience in stitches . \nlike the first film ( and perhaps in homage to it ) , there\'s a real penchant for dialogue which underlines the obvious . \nlast time around featured the hootworthy line uttered by forest whitaker\'s psychic empath character upon entering a bloodsoaked room -- \" something bad happened here . \" \nthis time , laura gets to stand over a fresh , shredded corpse with its entails ripped out and mutter \" this is awful . \" \nand she\'s not even empathic ! \nand when a psychotically horny patrick accosts a supermarket shopper and drags her kicking and screaming behind the building in a woefully-paced suspense sequence , eve , who\'s telepathically linked to her alien/human-hybrid counterpart ( whatever ) , helpfully tells our alien-hunting protagonists , \" he\'s going to rape her . \" \nwhile species ii is often unintentionally hilarious , at least it occasionally demonstrates a sense of humour of its own . \nthere\'s an amusing , tongue-in-cheek bit of product placement ( which doesn\'t really make much sense , but i appreciated the sentiment ) , as well as some supermarket-related hijinx ( \" he\'s in aisle 1 ! \" \ninforms eve ) . \nif the film maintained this sort of light-hearted tone , it would have been much more charming and enjoyable to watch , but , to its detriment , it instead takes its silly plot far too seriously and barrels along to a bloody , effects-ladened anticlimactic conclusion . \nmuch of the film fails to make a whole lot of sense , and there are such gaping plot holes that it\'s terribly difficult to contain any suspension of disbelief . \nthe implausibilities are endless : what about the toxic bomb in eve\'s brain ? \nwhy are the guards armed with guns when they already know firearms are ineffectual ? \nmy favourite was the slow-motion sequence in the film where eve , sporting superhuman strength , is shown tossing aside guards who are attempting to contain her with what look like body blocks . \nthis is the sort of movie which leaves you holding your head in amazed disbelief , incredulous that it\'s being foisted upon the public . \nreturning headlines michael madsen ( who reprises tough guy press lennox ) and ms . helgenberger do what they can with this goofy screenplay , but there\'s realistically only so much one can do with this script as a basis . \nmykelti williamson ( portraying astronaut dennis gamble ) churns out an all-too-familiar spin on a generic brash-mouthed character , and fine character actors george dzundza ( playing colonel burgess and looking ridiculous in the process ) and james cromwell ( patrick\'s neglectful father , senator ross ) are utterly wasted in the film . \nmr . lazard gives his character an appropriately shifty-eyed look , while returning vixen ms . henstridge is actually given the opportunity to act in one scene ( and acquits herself nicely ) , but is mostly relegated to reprising her familiar role of parading about in skimpy clothing ( or none at all ) . \nms . henstridge recently commented on how some female audiences have expressed appreciation for her character in the first entry of the species series , claiming that \" she\'s so empowered . \" \na lethal half-alien in heat who dispatches of her sexual partners in grotesque fashion -- now * that\'s * what i call empowerment . \n'~neg
'>from the commercials , this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight . \ninstead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end . \nthe concept is deceptively pedestrian . \nan adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way . \nthe movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea . \nthe son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents . \nfollowing one dead end lead after another , each funnier than the previous , they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin . \nit\'s difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot . \nseemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one . \nwithout giving too much away , one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol , tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion . \nand it\'s all done in a fairly clean , almost ( well , maybe not exactly ) family fare manner . \na grand cast ( tomlin , alda , moore , ben stiller , patricia arquette , tea leoni , george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs . \ndrawing from a more hyper woody allen style , the film succeeds beyond expectations . \n'~pos
'the sequel to the fugitive ( 1993 ) , u . s marshals is an average thriller using it\'s association with the fugitive just so it can make a few extra bucks . \ntommy lee jones returns to his role as chief deputy samuel gerard , the grizzly cop who was after harrison ford in the fugitive . \nthis time , he\'s after fugitive mark sheridan ( snipes ) who the police think killed two fbi agents , but of course he\'s been set up , and when the police plane escort he ( and gerard ) are riding crashes , he makes a run for it , gerard not so hot on his tail . \nwhat follows is about 2 hours of action , brought to us by the director of executive decision ( 1995 ) , another film curiously involving a plane . \nwhen comparing this movie to the fugitive , the prequel is far superior . \nbut even on it\'s own , u . s marshals is a pretty lousy movie . \nwhile the original was reasonably intelligent , and had a fugitive to root for , the audience feels strangely distanced from snipes fugitive , mainly because we know so little about him until way into the film\'s overlong running time . \nwhile the fugitive gave a little time to develop harrison fords character , u . s marshals is straight in there , pulling it\'s trump card ( the place crash ) almost immediately . \nto be honest , i couldn\'t care less if snipe\'s character got captured or not . \nsnipes performance is average , and his character gets surprisingly little screen time ( considering he is the fugitive ) for reasons i\'ll explain later . \ntommy lee jones is as fine as ever , although his role is hardly a challenge . \nthe sense of deja vu was overwhelming . \ni know it\'s the same role from the fugitive , but there is seemingly no attempt to develop his character from the last film . \nthere\'s a few \'nudge nudge\' references from the first film , but apart from that , nothing . \nnobody even mentions harrison ford in this movie . \ndowney jnr is ok as fbi agent john royce who\'s roped into the chase , and sexy french actress irene jacob wanders in and out of the movie as snipes wife . \nnobody looks as if their having a good time , and all the performers are on autopilot . \nthe supporting cast are o . k , but when it comes to performances , u . s marshals falls flat on it\'s face . \nit doesn\'t fare any better plot-wise , either . \nthe film starts off with gerard trying to capture snipes , but then veers off into terrorists territory . \nas said above , the film is an normal , average terrorist thriller , seen a million times before , but is using the fugitive reputation to make it sound more professional . \nif this film wasn\'t the \'sequel\' to the fugitive , this would probably go straight to video , or not even been made at all , because it\'s so average . \nand because of the film\'s plot changing it\'s course , snipes is almost forgotten apart , and hardly features in the movie . \nstuart baird , the director , is all right , but there\'s no particular scene that stands out . \nit\'s director is the usual action movie style . \neven the plane crash is sorely lacking in tension . \nthe special effects are nice , especially the plane crash , and there\'s a good ( if very loud ) soundtrack by veteran composer jerry goldsmith . \nbut in the end , u . s marshals suffers from an overwhelmingly lack of excitement . \nsure , it\'s loud and dumb , but in the end u . s marshals just ain\'t fun . \nbored performers and a lackluster plot and script , do not make a good action movie . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \n'~neg
'i\'m not quite sure how best to go about writing this review . \ni must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinson\'s political satire \" wag the dog , \" but in retrospect , this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it . \nquite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through , and it didn\'t do that . \nthey also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works , and it didn\'t quite do that either . \na few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubrick\'s \" dr . \nstrangelove \" in the tradition of political black comedy , and it most definitely didn\'t do that . \nthat said , \" wag the dog \" is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them . \nthe story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president , who is up for re-election in two weeks , sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office . \nthe accusations , the script suggests , are probably untrue , but as brean so pointedly puts it , that isn\'t particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the president\'s campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood . \nbrean , along with his assistant ( anne heche ) , decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor . \nas i said , \" wag the dog \" is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected , but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here , such as when , in an echo of a familiar movie clich ? , the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting , inspirational music , then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform \" we have the right to fight for democracy . \" \nanother scene shows us how , with modern editing equipment , an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village . \nthe most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda team\'s attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt . \nwilliam \" old shoe \" schumann ( woody harrelson ) , an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho . \nof course , not everything goes as planned ; the cia , for example , realizes what\'s going on and strikes a deal with the president\'s electoral opponent to report to the media that the \" fighting \" has ended , forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis . \nstill , even with the cia\'s involvement , the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable . \nregardless of the official word from the president or the cia , wouldn\'t the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is , in fact , no fighting going on in albania ? \nthe film never addresses this question , nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical , such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt . \nschumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it . \nthere was also an instance , towards the end of the film , in which one of motss\'s forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away . \nwith these plot holes , \" wag the dog \" doesn\'t quite work as a satire of american politics , but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place . \nbrean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather , they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off . \nthe film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end , as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret . \nmotss and his hollywood buddies , meanwhile , seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project . \nin fact , one of the sources of conflict in the film is motss\'s increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind , it is the greatest work of art he has ever created . \ni think it\'s fair to say that \" wag the dog \" underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire . \nstill , the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one . \nwag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks , what if the war wasn\'t even real ? \nwith this premise and the talented cast , the film still delivers more consistently than most , whatever its flaws . \n'~pos
'one of the contributors to the destruction of the batman film franchise chris o\'donnell stars in this remake of buster keaton\'s 1925 silent film seven chances . \nnow i\'ve never seen seven chances , as i\'m more of a chaplin fan than a keaton fan , but i seriously doubt that the classic version could be as insipid as this . \no\'donnell plays jimmie shannon , the manager of a pool table manufacturing company . \nhe also fears commitment , and despite dating anne ( renee zellweger ) for over three years , he\'s unwilling to marry her . \nhis reasons ? \nwell he\'s a guy you see , and well , guys are like stallions , and they apparently don\'t like to be roped or something ( hey , that\'s the movie\'s explanation . . . \ni\'d marry renee zellweger in a second ) . \neventually it comes time for jimmie to propose , and when he does , it\'s the most absurd proposal ever uttered by a man ever . \nhe essentially says to her , \" you win \" and hands her a ring . \nthe audience should now hate this character . \ni did . \nthen the meat of the plot presents itself . \njimmie\'s grandfather ( peter ustinov , completely wasted ) dies and leaves jimmie his entire estate of 100 million dollars as well as ownership of the pool table business . \nhowever , in order to get the money and save the jobs of the factory workers , jimmie must be married before his next birthday ( which is just over 24 hours away ) . \nhaving blown his chances with anne , jimmie proceeds to track down all his prior girlfriends and suggest a \" business proposition \" . \nthe movie wasn\'t half bad by this time , surprisingly . \nit wasn\'t boring me , and even managed to read my thoughts at one point . \nustinov\'s character left a video will , and while he\'s reading the ridiculous clause in it , i thought to myself \" what is this , brewster\'s millions ? \" . \nas soon as i thought it , hal holbrook\'s character actually says \" what is this , brewster\'s millions ? \" \nit was quite surreal . \nsomething happens though during the film\'s final act that caused me to sharply drop the rating it was going to receive . \nup to that point , all of jimmie\'s prior girlfriends had turned down his \" business proposition \" which i felt was good . \nat least the film wasn\'t painting women to be cold hearted gold diggers . \nwhen jimmie has no other options , his goofy friend ( played by artie lange , making a career out of playing the goofy friend ) places an ad in the newspaper that somehow becomes a front page story . \nat this point , 100 , 000 women don wedding gowns and head off to persuade jimmie to pick them to be his bride . \nthese women arrive at jimmie\'s location and immediately start bullying him about what he\'s looking for in a woman . \nwhen he\'s had enough of their unjustified attacks , he tells the angry mob that there\'s been a mistake and he won\'t be marrying any of them . \nas a result , the women proceed to chase him around the city , in hopes of catching him and tearing his limbs off . \nthis goes on for the rest of the film . \nit\'s just chris o\'donnell running from 100 , 000 obnoxious , greedy , angry and stupid women . \nmy groans of disgust could be heard for miles . \nthe film finally ended ( thankfully ) , but to this day i\'m still groaning . \nthe bachelor is available on dvd from new line home video . \nit contains the film in both full frame and in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1 , cast and crew info , and special dvd-rom features . \nthe original theatrical trailer is also on the disc , which contains scenes not in the film . \napparently there was even more footage of the gang of brides chasing o\'donnell around the city , and at one point o\'donnell is leaping from the tops of buses . \nso that was bad enough to be cut , but the other 30 minutes of bride shenanigans was good ? \nugh . \n'~neg
'the sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible . \npeople may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized , methodical hatred . \nfive concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days , the first documentary from steven spielberg\'s survivors of the shoah visual history foundation . \nthe five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry . \nas the introduction explains , even as germany started to lose the war , the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe . \nin 1944 , hungary had the last big population of jews within germany\'s reach , and they became the last target of hitler\'s \" final solution . \" \neach of the five tells his or her story . \ntheir stories are intercut chronologically , starting from normal life in pre-war hungary . \nthey recall the nazi invasion of hungary , being sent to \" work \" camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps . \nthey recall their horrible , precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope . \neach recalls his or her unfathomable , eventual liberation . \nand finally , the last days shows their cathartic , pained , modern-day return to their old homes and the camps . \nneedless to say , their stories are horrifying , amazing , and emotionally draining . \nby themselves , the stories would be forceful testaments , but by cutting them in parallel , their impact is multiplied by five . \nthe last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- it\'s mostly pictures of people telling their stories , intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage . \nin this kind of movie it\'s almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen , but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific , or at least relevant , images to go with his subjects\' narration . \nthe liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days . \nit\'s not clear which scene it is . \nit could be one of two that i hadn\'t seen before , both powerful . \none is rare color footage , shot by an american , of piles of victims in cattle cars . \nthere is something jarring , something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color , when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white . \nanother segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore . \nthere has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say . \nbut by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war , moll told a specific part of the story in a new way , in greater detail . \nand i\'m glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject . \nthe transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful . \nx-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary , but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring , when skies are blue and trees are green . \nalso , the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! ) , \nso the richness and detail are impeccable . \nthe dvd\'s features are plentiful and well-chosen . \nthere is a theatrical trailer for the movie , which is a great introduction to the subject matter . \nthere are about fifty still photos , both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors . \nalso , the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen ) , both on the same side . \none of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) . \nyou\'d think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary , but they\'re not bloopers . \ninstead , they are solid , moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length . \none of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film . \nrenee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch , a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz . \nfirestone was aggressive , questioning the doctor about what his children thought . \nthe doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable . \nanother of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz . \nhe ends his prayer by saying \" . . . forgive me for surviving . \" \nit\'s ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film . \nit\'s ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable , television , and movies . \nit\'s ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers . \nbut the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well . \nit\'s only fitting that the dvd , with its wealth of interesting and relevant features , would also be ambitious and successful . \n'~pos
'the happy bastard\'s quick movie review \nholy man \nmore like holy crap . \nthe film stars eddie murphy as a mystical-ish figure named g on a strange journey of some sort when he comes across two network execs ( jeff goldblum and kelly preston ) with a flat tire on their hands . \nsomehow he ends up in their car and on their channel , a line-up of infomercial programs featuring the likes of betty white , morgan fairchild , and a slew of other celebrities and nameless figures . \nit\'s here that he seems to hit his stride , speaking of life instead and somehow boosting sales . \nat this point in the movie , of course , morality comes into play , particularly on goldblum , who suddenly feels he can market the magical g into megabucks to get in good with his boss ( robert loggia ) . \nit doesn\'t take long for the movie to unfold into sappy mush , with realizations taking place left and right and poor plot points . \nonly a real zippy sequence involving frying morgan fairchild\'s face seems to have any interest in the movie . \nmurphy lends nothing to his character and poor goldblum looks as if he\'d rather be someplace else . \nsome may argue that the movie has a message , but all that came across to me is that i could probably get more entertainment watching that informercial with the guy in the question mark coat . \nat least he has something for us to laught at . . . \n'~neg
'it is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death . \nafter having said that , i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well . \none gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake , or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement . \nthere is no ocean , no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ? ordinary people\' . \nin fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie ) . \nso what are the lessons learnt : 1 . \ndon\'t take your children to class reunions . \n2 . don\'t leave them alone in the lobby , not even for a second . \nmichelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and mother , a trend that started with ? a thousand acres\' and ? one fine day\' . \nmy comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie , so much so that when she has a nervous break down , the veins on her temples bulge impressively . \nwhoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance , playing a lesbian cop , with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop . \nlastly , who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie ? my grandmother comes to mind . \n'~pos
'forget get carter . \ninstead . . . \nget me a cup of coffee . \nwhat the hell has happened to all good american action movies ? \ndid i unknowingly miss a meeting somewhere ? \nwhen did all of the bad-ass , kicking butt and taking names , gun-toting , crazed , vengeful characters of the 1980\'s -- from such films as commando , cobra , predator , raw deal , first blood -- suddenly turn into innocent , compassionate , sensitive , teary-eyed knuckleheads . \nthe only place to turn these days for an honest action film is towards the east -- and i don\'t mean new york city . \nget carter -- the latest masterpiece from uber-thespian sylvester stallone -- is a prime example of large and in charge 80\'s action stars trying to fit back into action roles they have long since outgrown . \nstallone seems like that one uncle you have who tries to be cool with his members only jacket and izod polo shirt with the collar popped up . \na few years ago , stallone made a movie that gave him the opportunity to gracefully exit the roles that typecast him as an action monkey . \nthat role was sheriff freddy heflin in copland -- a strange film about redemption within a broken soul . \nstallone actually gave an amazing performance and it seemed he had shaken off the past . \ntoo bad get carter returns stallone to action , but with the shiny paint rusted off on the edges . \nget carter is a simple story . \nstallone plays frank carter , a vegas bruiser for a loan shark ( played with amazing gusto by the uncredited voice of actor tom sizemore ) . \nwhen frank\'s brother gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident , frank , feeling all guilty and mushy inside , thinks foul play is involved and travels to seattle to set right all the wrongs with the patented \" carter\'s way \" . \nhe talks tough with his brother\'s wife , lends a helping had to his brother\'s daughter doreen ( rachel leigh cook ) , and walks around seattle in the pouring rain dressed like a lost member of the rat pack with a really bad goatee . \ncarter finds out that his brother was involved in some bad stuff with a slimy porn king played by ultra-cool , mcqueen-esque mickey rourke , a multi-millionaire computer geek ( alan cumming ) , and a strange foreign guy ( michael caine ) who speaks in riddles and talks tough . \ncarter stalks all of them while trying to figure out who did in his brother and how to extract proper revenge on the responsible parties . \nwhat a minute ! \nthis sounds just like another film i saw last year , the limey . \nbetter not tell terence stamp about stallone ripping him off . \nactually , get carter is a remake of the 1971 british production of the same name , starring caine in the title role ( and what with his cameo here , the cleverness is astonishing ) . \nwhile stallone still carries his own weight here , the movie lacks what the original did as well : purpose . \nthroughout the film , stallone looks like an old guy trying to act tough , while nobody is taking him seriously . \nhis one-liners fall flat , and he seems tired and uncertain of all the actions , mental and physical , required of his character . \nthere is even a strange homoeroticism between rourke and stallone that lends a bizarre tone to their numerous conversations -- in both fists and words . \nthe biggest surprise in get carter is that the best job done in the film is by the versatile mickey rourke . \nan amazing method actor in the eighties who fell into drugs , spousal abuse , a boxing career , and an intolerable attitude towards not getting his way , rourke still brings a dangerous sense of purpose to his porn king character . \nhe may not win any oscars , but he still ranks highly in my book . \nget carter has great directing , strong acting by rourke and caine , and energetic car chases that would make william friedkin proud . \nthe only thing it lacks - as with most hollywood productions -- is a good script and proper casting . \nnever mind that it should never have been made at all . \n'~neg
'i know that \" funnest \" isn\'t a word . \n \" fun \" is a noun , and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective . \nbut that\'s the word that came to me right after viewing \" chicken run . \" \nno wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions , like \" that was the funnest movie i\'ve ever seen ! \" \nso to hell with webster\'s -- \" chicken run \" is one of the funnest movies i\'ve seen in a while . \ni can\'t remember the last time i\'ve seen anything funner . \nthe chickens at tweedy\'s farm are up to something . \nliving in a concentration camp-like atmosphere , they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught , subsequently spending day after day in the coal box . \none night , a brash american rooster flies in over the fence , calling himself rocky ( mel gibson ) , famous flying rooster and circus performer . \nrocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly , and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farm\'s egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan . \nshe orders a huge pie-making machine , cackling , \" chickens go in ; pies come out . \" \nwhat sort of pies ? \nchicken pies , of course . \nco-director nick park and his studio , aardman animation , produced three oscar-winning short films : \" creature comforts , \" \" the wrong trousers , \" and \" a close shave . \" \nthe latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit , a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures . \npart of what made the \" wallace \" films brilliantly entertaining was park\'s uncanny ability to make an old story seem new . \n \" the wrong trousers , \" for example , pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks , and \" a close shave \" owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories . \nbut in the hands of park and his team , the stories felt fresh and inspired , and not the least bit contrived . \nnow teaming with co-director peter lord , park has created a similar creature in \" chicken run . \" \nthe plot is largely lifted from \" the great escape \" ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene ) , with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement . \nthing is , the film doesn\'t feel like it\'s been lifted from somewhere else ; \" chicken run \" feels fresh , alive , like nothing else ever done . \npart of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ? \npark and lord milk the incongruity for all it\'s worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious , and to them , it is . \nbut they\'re * chickens * , so it\'s funny to us . \nanother thing that helps \" chicken run \" ( and most of park\'s films ) succeed is the animators\' subtle way of giving nods to the very films they\'re cribbing . \nthere are references to \" the great escape , \" obviously , and \" stalag 17 . \" \nthe chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both \" raiders of the lost ark \" and \" indiana jones and the temple of doom . \" \nthere\'s even a nod to \" the blues brothers , \" if you can believe it , and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor , taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibson\'s nationality and film history . \nthe \" braveheart \" reference is a hoot if you catch it . \nwhen you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one , \" chicken run \" is downright brilliant in its execution . \nconsider this : since july of last year , i\'ve seen dozens upon dozens of \" blair witch project \" parodies , on television , on the radio , and online . \nout of all those , maybe one or two were amusing , the rest tiresome . \nwhy ? \nbecause once you got past the thought that \" they\'re parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch\' movie , \" most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight , no original idea , no greater purpose . \nthey were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise , you got nothing . \nconversely , \" chicken run \" doesn\'t lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene . \nif you\'ve never seen \" indiana jones , \" the chase sequence is still fun . \neven if you have no idea who mel gibson is , rocky remains an interesting character . \npark , lord , and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before it\'s understood , and as a result , \" chicken run \" is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious , but not quite vague either . \nenjoyment of this movie doesn\'t require knowledge of film history , but if you\'ve got it , \" chicken run \" is that much richer . \nthe voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances , and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that it\'s hard not to fall in love with every one of them . \nginger is perfect , spunky and opinionated , but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind , and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on \" absolutely fabulous \" ) nails it . \nshe has warm , human chemistry with gibson , whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer . \nthe characters\' inevitable romance doesn\'t feel contrived , but sweet . \npoor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way , but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out , and his overbearing wife certainly isn\'t any help . \njane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners , all while perpetually crocheting a sweater ) , and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence . \nthey even come up with an inspired riff on something that\'s baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma . \none might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome , but as with most of \" chicken run , \" it comes as a delightful surprise . \nthe film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults , brits and yanks , rats and chickens . \nthe animation is first-rate . \nremember that this was all done the old-fashioned way , with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit , and you see just how truly remarkable \" chicken run \" really is . \nthis movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios\' animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail . \nas in such top-notch family fare as \" a bug\'s life \" or \" toy story 2 , \" \" chicken run \" has something to offer in nearly every frame . \ncertainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes , but a active , attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because they\'ll catch all the details . \nanyway , the movie\'s just a boatload of fun . \nfunnest damn movie i\'ve seen all year . \n'~pos

'capsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg . \njoe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs . \nit lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure . \nthe film is neither ambitious nor pretentious . \ni had a good time . \n , low +2 ( -4 to +4 ) \nhere goes my credibility . \nthis is a film on which i expect to be in a minority . \ni liked the third jurassic park film . \ni even liked the second jurassic park film . \nin a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichton\'s novel the lost world , arthur conan doyle\'s novel the lost world , and the classic silent film version of the doyle . \njp2 was an adventure , as doyle said , \" for the boy who\'s half man or the man who\'s half boy . \" \nthat is what all the jurassic park films are . \nexpecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house . \nthe classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomon\'s mines had under-written characters also . \njurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs . \nthe characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be , and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting . \nsome of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds . \nthat degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require . \ni feel i got my money\'s worth . \nthe story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica . \nthis was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park . \nthey hope , no doubt , to get a look at the island\'s dinosaurs from a safe height . \nthe height is safe , but driving the boat in the water is not . \nthe two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended . \nflash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide . \nhe has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs . \nbut again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go . \ndoing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs . \nthey too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn . \nhe will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once . \nright . \nguess what happens next ? \njp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 . \nfirst it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm . \nsattler has a much smaller part in jp3 , but is still present to tie this story to the first . \ncuriously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance . \none thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other , suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time . \nthey did not appear to be conversing in the previous films . \nof course , these raptors look a little different also , so perhaps they are a different related species . \nnot only are they more intelligent than in the past films , they are also more sympathetic . \nin this story they are not just killing machines , they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition . \nthis time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized . \neach new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs , of course . \nin this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus , not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus , but larger and presumably more nasty . \nit has a crocodile\'s head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright . \nperhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs . \nsometimes they just move too fast to see . \noccasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision . \na few times we get unconvincing matte shot , particularly of the laboratory . \nbut there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films . \nthe musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williams\'s score for the first film . \njoe johnston , who directs , already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky . \na team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay . \nthe film they have made is a long way from great cinema , but it still is fun . \nif you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today , the film is for you . \ni rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n'~pos
'what would you do if no one could see you ? \nwell , if you\'re a super smart bio-molecular research scientist working for the military , you\'d grope a co-worker and rough-up your neighbor from across the street . \nthat\'s right . \nof all the non-criminal possibilities brought about by rendering oneself invisible , in \" hollow man \" kevin bacon\'s character opts to commit sex crimes . \ner , it\'s kevin bacon who plays the super smart military bio-molecular research scientist ? \nsomething sounds horribly wrong already . \nbut this is a paul verhoeven film , and the sleazepin director of such open-crotch classics as \" basic instinct \" and the infamous \" showgirls \" never lets a little credibility get in the way of his voyeuristic tendencies which , when you come right down to it , is all this film is about . \n \" hollow man \" features a string of hapless , c-list actors ( among them bacon , elisabeth shue , josh brolin , and kim dickens ) in a grade-z plot with a lot of special effects that , frankly , don\'t look much better than those used in the 1933 version of \" the invisible man . \" \noh bacon glistens when he gets wet all right and looks like a rather fatty side of cheap flank steak when he\'s attempting reentry but otherwise it\'s lots of \" thermal \" shots and inanimate objects ( elisabeth shue included ) bobbing around without any visible signs of support . \nsince invisibility , once achieved , isn\'t much of an effect ( the actors spend half their time conversing with nobody and the other half of their time talking to each other--it amounts to much of a muchness ) , the director elects to wardrobe all of his female protagonists in loosely-buttoned sweaters so that the minute bacon\'s character gets invisible he can head straight for them . \nit\'s as if that fascinating concept--what would you do if no one could see you ? --is \nsimply a verhoeven ploy to show some skin . \nas a horror film , \" hollow man \" is unsophisticated and disturbing ( in its intent , not its achievements ) and not worth your time or your hard-earned dollars . \nit\'s minor verhoeven--and even that\'s not saying much--and boy is it hollow . \n'~neg
'just look back two years ago at the coen brothers\' comedic gem the big lebowski , change the actors , take away the bowling alley , add a record store , and you\'ve got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornby\'s novel high fidelity came first ) . \neither way , it\'s been done before , a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances , yet it remains consistently funny . \nwhy is this ? \nmaybe because you know your life is much better than this , you know these guys are more pathetic than you are , and you know its ok to laugh at them because they\'re fictional . \ndirector stephen frears , possibly not intentionally , has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day . \nwhen watching high fidelity , expect to laugh at someone else\'s pain , realize what you are laughing at , and then laugh again . \ni laughed at dick ( todd louiso ) , the shy , timorous , steve buscemi character of lebowski , who seems to know what he is talking about but either can\'t put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends . \ni laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black ) , an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons , pudgy , egotistic , and obnoxious at the same time . \nand i laughed at rob ( john cusack ) , the jeff bridges type , whom the story revolves around . \nrob is the character easiest to relate to , but he is nothing like you at all . \nhe uncontrollably cheats and lies , then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman . \nand like his other miserable friends , pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort . \nhe spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it . \nwhatever human emotions the clash , aretha franklin , and bruce springsteen records hold , rob and co . \ngrasp them and help fill voids in their social lives . \nrob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in . \nduring this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on , rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him . \nbut these aren\'t any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( rob\'s incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) . \nthe plot in three words is : women and music . \nthe approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective . \nit gives high fidelity a quickly paced , informal structure , adjectives which perfectly parallel rob\'s own lifestyle . \nit also helps open the viewer\'s eyes as to how annoying barry is . \njack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball . \njust listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob , who must work with him every day of the week . \nwhat frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes . \njohn cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast , consisting of big stars and character actors , that really defines rob . \nnow instead of rob just talking to the camera , after he explains something , the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say . \nthe only problem with high fidelity is that it doesn\'t end when it should have ended . \ninstead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that . \nalso bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie . \nhigh fidelity is a cheerful , old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs . \ni just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen , they make everyone look and feel great . \n'~pos
'roger ebert asks in his review of sexy beast , \" who would have guessed that the most savage mad-dog frothing gangster in recent movies would be played by . . . \nben kingsley ? \" \nmy response would be that anyone who has seen alan arkin in wait until dark , henry fonda in once upon a time in the west , or anthony hopkins in the silence of the lambs should have guessed it . \nthey should know that the way for a film to create a really creepy sociopath is cast someone who generally plays mild , sympathetic , or even ineffectual character roles . \nthe same characteristics that make an actor seem gentle in most of his roles can work in his favor when a role calls for him to be fierce and vicious . \nthat is the principle that works for kingsley in sexy beast . \ngary \" gal \" dove ( played by ray winstone ) has retired from a london career of crime and is living on a luxurious villa in spain . \nlife has become a routine of sunning himself and relaxing . \nbut his paradise is about to be shattered by a one-two-punch . \nthe first punch is a boulder that comes rolling down the hill next to the villa . \nthe second punch comes from gal\'s past . \nback in london gang boss teddy bass ( ian mcshane , tv\'s lovejoy ) is planning to break into a safety deposit room in a bank and he wants gal . \nhe sends his most rabid henchman don logan ( ben kingsley ) to fetch gal . \ndon will accept any decision gal makes from \" yes \" to \" certainly . \" \nhowever , if gal says \" no \" don will do whatever it takes to turn it into a yes including threatening guy\'s ex-porn- star wife deedee ( amanda redman ) . \nin the meantime don knows just how to get under everybody\'s skin . \nkingsley makes don a compact package of fury and nastiness . \nthere are some serious problems in louis mellis\'s and david scinto\'s script that should have been caught before filming . \nwhen we see the actual crime we have no idea why gal was so important to its success . \nbeyond an ability to use skin-diving gear , no special talents are required of him . \nany local hood could have done what gal is needed for . \nadditionally the crime involves digging from a swimming pool to the bank vault , flooding the vault . \nno only could they have let the water out of the pool and avoided the complication altogether , but there is by far too much water to be accounted for by what was in the pool . \nin spite of the provocative title , the story is cliched and overly familiar . \ni know i have seen all the plot elements of sexy beast in old westerns like the law and jake wade . \nthe story is usually of the reformed outlaw , a robert taylor type , who has hung up his guns and is trying for a life of peaceful respectability . \nthe old gang , however , wants to do one more job with their old buddy and sends a rabid richard widmark type to go and git ? im . \nit is not a great plot . \nin sexy beast even the plot twists have gray beards . \nperhaps the film has a little more respectability because it was made not as a western but as a stylish british gangster film . \nit is an old plot dressed up to look new . \nif the plot is old , at least the style is creative . \nthis is director jonathan glazer\'s first film , but he has reputedly done some notable tv ads for guinness stout . \nhis style does have some unexpected touches including some very odd dream sequences . \ncinematographer ivan bird uses a lot of half lit scenes . \nwe see one side of a person\'s faces . \nbut the other side fades into the darkness , a sort of metaphor for the half-world these characters in-habit . \nhalf of everything that is happening is also kept hidden . \nus yanks will have a hard time with some of the dialog . \nat least in my theater it was difficult to make out the words with the quiet speaking , the heavy accents , and the cockney language . \nsexy beast is a very and familiar minor plot lent respectability in the us by being done in what is here a still somewhat novel genre , the london crime film . \nthe plot may be new to british crime films , but it would be overly familiar as a western . \nfurther respectability comes from ben kingsley\'s high-powered performance . \ni give it a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \n'~neg
'plot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes . \nhe is taken prisoner along with some other humans , and tries his best to escape his simian captors . \noh yeah , and did i mention that the apes can talk ? \nkewl ! \ncritique : despite this film not looking like a \" tim burton movie \" or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself , i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun , summer fare . \nalthough the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations . \ni mean , i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real ! \ni also have to \" give it up \" to all of the actors inside the costumes , not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours , but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well . \ni especially enjoyed bonham carter\'s performance , who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roth\'s bad guy , who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part . \nplot-wise , i liked the beginning of the film , the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village , the escape and most of the fight scenes , but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence ) , i kinda lost a bit of my interest . \ni was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of \" human beings as animals \" then i was about the end battle sequence , which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film . \ni also hated the \" kid \" character who just got on my nerves and didn\'t really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i won\'t ruin it here but c\'mon guys . . . you \ncoulda thought of something a little more plausible than that , no ? ) . \nbut the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character , his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests . \nthis dude didn\'t seem to give a rat\'s ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didn\'t really care about what happened to him either . \nnow i\'m not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script , but the film suffered because of it . \nvisually , the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! ) , but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton . \nthe \" surprise ending \" that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968 , felt a little tacked on here , and despite being interesting , didn\'t really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) . \nso overall , i loved the whole \" feel \" of the planet , the apes that ruled it , the manner in which they treated the humans , screamed , shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain , but didn\'t appreciate the film\'s lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring . \nbut i would still recommend this film as a fun , summer movie with laughs , creepiness and a really cool premise . \nps : for anyone who has seen the original , i cannot believe that they didn\'t at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case , mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which he\'s suddenly been thrust ( \" this is a mad house ! \" - \ntype of thing ) . \nthe guy in this film barely seems to be \" put off \" by the fact that he\'s surrounded by apes who can speak english ! ! \nwhere\'s joblo coming from ? \nthe arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mars ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet of the apes ( 9/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 ) \n'~pos

'starting with the little mermaid and most recently the lion king , the walt disney company once again proved that they could not only consistently make modern day animated classics , but were particularly in touch with what the general viewing public--particularly kids-- wanted to see . \ntherefore , it\'s with some surprise that as a big fan of the above mentioned movies i was so disappointed with pocahontas . \ndespite some innovation and risk taking , the story is surprisingly straightforward and dramatized in broad strokes , as are its characters . \na group of englishmen lead by the evil governor ratcliffe come to the new world in search of gold with no regard for the \" savages \" that live there . \nthe natives look upon the english with just as much fear and distrust . \nonly the love between the beautifully structured pocahontas and the dashing captain john smith can prevent a terrible clash . \nthe ending , as it turns out , is not entirely a happy one and is one of the film\'s finer moments . \nthe characters are mixtures of stereotypes and lack any real depth . \ngovernor ratcliffe , for instance , is a snobbish , single-minded bore whose mere appearance is supposed to bring about hisses . \ncaptain john smith is a blond hunk who , while \" slightly \" misguided , is good at heart . \npocahontas herself is the typical disney heroine who is practically being forced to marry a man who everyone but her likes and finds the man of her dreams just in time . \nshe even comes complete with insignificant best friend . \nagain , against tradition , talking animals aren\'t used , but a lusty , wizened , talking tree is . \nthis is an odd compromise , but it\'s one of the few elements that really work . \nthe animals are a delight , and what brief time their interactions take place brings the only humor and fun to a rather bland presentation . \nmaybe it would have been a better film if we saw the story unfold through their eyes . \nthe talking tree , who seems to have a thing for john smith , is the only other character that can hold our interest and is perhaps the best developed of the bunch . \nthe music , a welcome delight in the later disney films , is mostly a let down here , with the exception of the catchy and motivational , \" colors of the wind . \" \nmel gibson , as the voice of john smith , has a solid singing voice and should have been used more . \nthe opposite holds true for the governor ratcliffe led songs ; the singing is even more grating than his simplistic character . \ni was rather bored through what turned out to be a shorter than expected running time . \neven the children in the audience seemed restless . \nwhile there\'s no stopping a kid from seeing something that they want--or disney wants them to--most i believe will be disappointed . \nperhaps the biggest problem is that disney has strayed from their familiar fable and fairy tale themes to history . \nit\'s all right to change or embellish fantasy to suit a movie\'s entertainment value , but doing so to historical facts doesn\'t work nearly as well as creating nagging questions in the viewer\'s minds and plot holes that are never filled . \neven the artwork , another disney strong point , varies greatly in quality , making any story problems even more obvious . \nas mentioned above , there were many questions that stayed with me while viewing the film . \nfor instance , if john smith was truly such a world traveler and had so much experience with \" savages , \" why did he so quickly change his previous \" kill as many indians as i can \" attitude . \nif he was such a nice guy after all , he should have changed his ways long before this . \nor how about pocahontas\' amazing english speaking ability when this had supposedly been the first time she had seen white men ? \ni can understand making the native americans speak english for the benefit of the audience , but simply saying that they had met a missionary years earlier would have cleared up a lot ; history was modified in the film anyway . \nas it is , i wonder if it doesn\'t give kids the wrong impression . \nin short , the film is too simplistic for adults and contains too much romance and not enough action or humor for the younger set . \nwhile disney tried valiantly in many ways to break with some of their firmest traditions , they end up failing on too many levels . \n'~neg
'in brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers . \nfull of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture . \ngo see it ! \nso , i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on \" hard copy \" with pam smart , the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980\'s . \n \" hard copy \" \'s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidman\'s fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for . \nsmart replied that she thought kidman\'s character came off as a dumb , vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal . \n ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . ) \nsmart\'s got a point . \nit wouldn\'t be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version . \nhowever , given a choice between the mass media \'happening\' of the real event and the fictionalized movie , i would definitely opt for the later . \nreal murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart , while pretty and alluring , is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman . \nto die for begins in a town called little hope , new hampshire , the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb . \nthe story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being \'on tv . \' \nof course , one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry , played by matt dillon . \nbut , with a little imagination , some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement , our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life , at least temporarily . \nkidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne . \ni have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture . \nher portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates . \nkidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven , post-feminist uber-temptress from hell . \nshe is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue , which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way . \nat one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law . \n \" you know , \" she knowingly exclaims , \" gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever , if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head . \" \nher husband beams at suzanne\'s profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters . \nthis is very close to pop culture bashing heaven , folks . \nthe other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix . \nhe plays jimmy , a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzanne\'s sexual favors . \nkidman\'s character , vapid though she is , is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia , winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland . \nphoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv , of course ) . \nhis jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he ain\'t going anywhere , ever . \nphoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne , someone who actually noticed him . \ngus van sant ( drugstore cowboy , my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate . \nhe keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along . \nvan sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesn\'t stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions . \nvan sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to \'get it\' without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story . \nthe screenplay , by buck henry , is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines i\'ve heard since heathers . \nhenry\'s story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame , yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters . \nhenry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic . \ndanny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric , loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands . \neither film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties . \nall-in-all , a wonderful production , well worth your seven bucks ! \nto die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus

'i relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool . \ni spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage , grousing to myself about its transparently planes , trains and automobiles plot machinations , and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement . \nthis was a mass market romantic comedy , after all , a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and , even in its best days , worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm . \nthen marc lawrence did something wonderful , something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups . \nit certainly didn\'t look that way from the outset , which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party , surrounded by friends and family whooping over his \" last night of freedom . \" \nben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney ) , but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this \'till death do you part business . \nthen , on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah , ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock ) , a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her . \nas transportation troubles thwart them at every turn , ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger , ben seeing in sarah the chances he\'s never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability she\'s never had . \nforces of nature gets off to a solid enough start , setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue . \nben is an ideal role for affleck\'s easy-going charm , and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation . \nsandra bullock , for her part , is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined , avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping . \nthe two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start , yet the script\'s apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely . \nlively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis , forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification . \nthe kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose , leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution . \nforces of nature isn\'t about a man developing a fear of commitment ; it\'s about a man learning what commitment means _to him_ , learning that it\'s not what he thought it was . \nlawrence\'s script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending , an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense . \nearlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance , and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine . \nthough one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film , and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples , forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that you\'ll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom . \nthat is , provided you\'re not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes . \nfor a brisk romantic comedy , forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots , why-not low or high angles , sweeping pans . \noccasionally the hyper-real approach works , with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often , hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is , covering it with flourishes so thick you almost can\'t find what\'s underneath . \na script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director , but even hughes\' excesses can\'t spoil this unique concoction . \nforces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant , something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents . \n'~pos

'warning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film \" fail-safe . \" \nif you haven\'t seen the film yet , proceed with caution . \nnutshell : a relevant , intelligent , suspenseful drama . \nstill powerful today , even after the end of the cold war . \n-------------------- \" fail-safe \" ( usa , 1964 ) drama , 111 minutes \nscreenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet \nreview by jamahl epsicokhan -------------------- \nthe most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesn\'t have a winning side and a losing side . \nin a nuclear confrontation , everybody loses , and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives . \nthe idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs . \nthis is the theme of sidney lumet\'s \" fail-safe , \" a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler . \n \" fail-safe \" takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis ) , when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism . \nthe premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws . \nfive u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america . \nthe unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner , but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers . \nsuddenly out of contact , and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives , the bomber pilots cannot be recalled , and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike . \na great deal of \" fail-safe \" \'s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russia\'s borders--at any cost . \nthe plot is compelling , and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios . \nthe reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails . \ngeneral bogan ( frank overton ) , taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda ) , is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated , pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable , simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable . \nthe events in \" fail-safe \" are fascinating because they\'re anything but predictable , but the real reason \" fail-safe \" works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot . \na key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war , communism , the cold war , and the united states\' role in all of it . \nmost of this is through the film\'s use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau ) , an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who , incidentally , is on the president\'s advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war . \nmany of the film\'s most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices . \nearly in the film , he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of \" strategy \" in a nuclear assault to \" minimize \" casualties . \n \" what\'s the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ? \" \na guest asks impatiently . \n \" forty million , \" groeteschele responds wryly . \nthe problem with groeteschele\'s mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war . \nthe only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals . \ngroeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over . \nyet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off , as general black ( dan o\'herlihy ) has often recommended . \non the contrary--according to groeteschele , that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s . , which would clearly put america at a disadvantage . \nsuch a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race . \n \" fail-safe \" clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war , and , likewise , it becomes a central theme in the film . \nwhy continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ? \nis it wise ? \nis it even logical ? \nno , not really . \nalthough \" fail-safe \" is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism , there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial , one-sided sort of way . \nagain , this is achieved through groeteschele , who is easily the film\'s most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance . \nin addition to providing the central \" pro-nuclear war \" voice that the film warns against , he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism . \nthe context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib . \none of groeteschele\'s \" logical \" trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that it\'s merely absurd . \nhe labels the average marxist an \" unfeeling , calculating machine \" that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself . \ngroeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow , the soviets will * instantly * surrender , for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russia\'s home soil--which must be preserved at all costs . \ngroeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would . \nthe irony here is groeteschele\'s own mechanical theorizing . \nhe is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesn\'t even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns . \nonce the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible , the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be . \njust how will the soviet union\'s leader react , and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ? \n ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? ) \nwith the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman ) , the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader , in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity , with lumet\'s long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame , exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader . \nwithout getting into too much detail , i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly , yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances . \n ( that is , as sensible as a nuclear \" incident \" can probably be . ) \nit does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war , something that simply isn\'t possible because of its all-too-real consequences . \ndramatically , the ending is quite powerful , and the use of o\'herlihy\'s character as the symbolic \" matador \" ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the film\'s opening ) , is particularly appropriate . \n \" fail-safe \" is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures ) , and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film . \nnevertheless , under lumet\'s direction and walter bernstein\'s intelligent adaptation of burdick\'s and wheeler\'s novel , the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded . \nthe film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming . \nbut it was the conscious , human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that \" fail-safe \" also finds dangerous . \nin retrospect , the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century . \nit\'s just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down , rather than continuing groeteschele\'s dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown . \n'~pos
'you don\'t need to have seen the original \" species \" to appreciate how utterly lousy \" species ii \" is . \nwith few exceptions , sequels tend to be worse than the films that spawned them , but the fact that \" species ii \" is a follow-up isn\'t the only reason it\'s so miserable . \nit\'s the predictable storyline , the cardboard characters , the banal dialogue , the failed attempts at humor , the revolting special effects , the gratuitous nudity ( all female , of course ) , the bad acting , and the bland direction . \nthe plot , simply geared at getting the alien species back on planet earth so that it can reak some more havoc , involves three astronauts landing on mars and inadvertently bringing some alien slime in a soil sample back aboard their shuttle . \nthe slime , well , sort of jumps out at them and the screen turns black . \nthat should have been the end of the movie right there . \nback on terra firma , at least one of the crew is now a carrier of alien dna and , as you\'ll remember if you saw the first movie , driven by a strong urge to procreate . \non a parallel track , government scientists have cloned a version of sil from the first film ( now called eve , again \" played \" by natasha henstridge ) and are keeping her around for some testing . \nthis , apparently , includes observing eve\'s reaction to \" the dukes of hazzard \" tv show , which she appears to enjoy . \neve\'s bio-rhythms go off the scale each time one of her kinfolk \" mates , \" which we are forced to witness in gross-out detail , but otherwise there doesn\'t appear to be a whole lot of reason why henstridge is in this film , unless it was written into her contract ( let\'s hope it cited one sequel and one sequel only ) . \neve finally breaks free of her confines--and her bra--for the finale , but the effects are so messy you can\'t really see what\'s going on . \npeter boyle is totally wasted as an institutionalized scientist who screams \" i told \'em not to go ! \" \nat the top of his lungs , referring to the mars mission but more likely aimed at the makers of this piffle . \nmichael madsen reprises his role of press lennox ( so that he can enter high security areas , flash a badge and claim to be press , maybe ? ) , as does marg helgenberger as dr . laura baker , the one subjecting eve to the tv reruns . \nthey\'re both unbelievably wooden . \nwhat\'s a talented filmmaker like peter medak ( \" the ruling class , \" \" the krays , \" \" let him have it \" ) doing directing this tripe , i wonder . \nit\'s an unfortunate trend , this : once-talented directors throwing in the towel and lending their names to unchallenging horror flicks like \" species ii . \" \nlast year peter hyams gave us \" the relic \" ; no thanks necessary there . \nand the first \" species \" was helmed by roger donaldson who , although certainly no genius behind the camera , had demonstrated much better judgment with his previous choice of projects . \nis it just that there are no better offers out there ? \n \" species ii \" is worthless . \nworse than that , it\'s also exploitative , offensive , and insulting to the intelligence at every turn . \nit\'s not that there isn\'t anything positive to say about the film . \nthere is . \nafter 92 minutes , it ends . \n'~neg
'andrew lloyd webber\'s musicals , preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice , present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time . \nwebber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as \" oklahoma ! , \" or the slapstickness of shows like \" a funny thing happened on the way to the forum . \" \nthey instead tackle hot issues from our past , and view them differently , and pack them together with redundant , catchy music , as well as thoughtful lyrics . \nlike \" jesus christ superstar , \" which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune \" superstar , \" a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didn\'t spread his message wider ) , \" evita \" takes an inventive stance on its topic , this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator , juan per ? n , eva , who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention , much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent , among other things ) . \n \" evita \" deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n , a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce ) , then died at the young age of 33 , creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common , although it wasn\'t like di slept to \" the top \" ) . \nwebber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals , but they always have a point for doing it . \nhere , they wish to expose her for what she is , but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks , her lying , and covering up for her fascist husband , but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions , and her death was very sad . \nit\'s also a musical , with almost no words not unsung . \nthe film plays like a rock opera , much like their \" jesus christ superstar , \" with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals , even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics , which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience , but also a very entertaining one . \nafter all , this is a musical , and webber\'s musicals never undermine this . \nthey are a balance of energy and intellectual depth , walking on a fine line between the both , and never stumbling on either side . \nthis is why the beginning of \" evita \" is kind of a let-down . \nokay , it is a let-down . \ni\'m not saying the opening moments are bad , because they\'re pretty good . \nbut what comes after is a lifeless , un-entertaining , and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand . \nin the musical , it\'s a fun , energetic sequence , culiminating in the show stopper , \" buenos aires , \" which is also lifeless . \nthen a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer , instead of her leaving him , where she ends up singing the sad tune , \" another suitcase in another hall , \" which was meant for a later character , screwed over by eva . \nthe portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft , seeming like parker and oliver stone , who adapted it for the screen , are afraid to present her for what she is , even while it\'s being narrated by a hater of eva\'s , the omnipotent ( antonio banderas ) , who presents her in a negative light . \nfor a while , it looks like alan parker can\'t pull it off . \nhowever , the film pulls itself together in a flash , and after that song is over , and the giddily nihilistic song \" goodbye and thank you , \" where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend , is magnificent , darkly comical , and just gleeful . \nfrom this point on , the film is hypnotic , satisfying , and satirical . \nno more punches are thrown , and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact . \nwe see eva woo and marry juan , get him out of jail , rise to stardom , falter a bit , come back , and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) . \nmore importantly , many of the themes from the musical carry on with this , as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work . \njuan , who is pretty underwritten in the musical , is given some extra scenes , and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory . \na muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan , and understand his sadness more than we did before . \n>from the \" goodbye and thank you \" number on , the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation , and saved a government , even while it left the nation\'s people downtrodden . \nbut despite this , the nation still loved eva , and when she slipped into death , the world mourned her because she was a star . \nthat\'s when our narrator , ch ? , comes out to show that she wasn\'t the great woman she really was , and expose her fame . \ndescribing this character is difficult , mainly because he has no real realistic background ( he\'s said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera , but the two probably could have never met , like they do in the film ) , but he serves as a perspective on eva , but even his perspective can\'t help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death . \nalan parker , no stranger to bizarre musicals ( he\'s done \" fame , \" \" the committments , \" \" bugsy malone , \" and \" pink floyd the wall \" - the latter which is absolutely brilliant ) , nails the film , exposing everything for what it is . \nwe cry for evita at the end because we feel we should , by the way it is presented . \nhis direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is . \nand there is energy throughout , with lots of bright colors , and scenes which are cinematically entertaning , as well as enriching and deep , such as the balcony scene where she sings \" don\'t cry for me , argentina , \" and her death sequence , which is poignant becuase of how sad it is . \nmadonna\'s golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly , remaning there for the rest of the film . \nat the beginning , she looks like she\'s too busy concentrating on her singing to act , but she eventually gets it right , though never really getting the presence of , say , patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) . \nher death , though , is brilliant . \nher singing could be better though . \ni know she took lessons to improve her range and all , but it still sounds like she\'s trying to hard . \nshe sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti \nlupone - i heard her sing on an old \" evita \" cd , and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) . \nbut it\'s generally very good , although not up to the brilliance the role really requires . \nantonio banderas , who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( i\'m one of the few people who thinks he rocks ) , is extremely comanding in his performance , presenting a lovable narrator . \nhis singing is very good , though nothing compared to the original , mandy patinkin . \nhe does have a pretty good singing voice , and a great range . \nand jonathan pryce is pretty awesome , although very brief at times , in his role as juan , seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade . \nalthough it gets off to a rocky start ( \" rocky \" \'s polite for what it really is ) , it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical . \nlike the other musical released in \'96 ( woody allen\'s \" everyone says i love you \" ) , it\'s a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead , but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance . \n'~pos
' \" something is fishy in the state of universal . \" \nabout ten years back , with the unexpected success of mad max and the road warrior , post-apocalypse nitty-gritty survival yarns became popular at the movies . \nwe\'ve always had movies of this nature ; on the beach , the end of the world , damnation alley , the ultimate warrior , and so on . \nto date , the most smoothly done were straightforward \" haircuts \" of the classic western plot , like the lone gunman who comes to town and protects the widow and the son against an evil organization , usually one in possession of some critical resource , like water , feed range , or a mining claim . \nmost of these grew out of venerable , but solid hero yarns like the virginian and shane . \n ( my personal favorite is a patrick swayze movie called steel dawn , which was fairly well made on a small budget . ) \nnow we have waterworld , which again brings the traditional lone gunman to town to rescue the young widow and her daughter . \n ( well , she\'s not a widow , and the kid isn\'t her daughter , but you get the idea . ) \nthe lady is helen , played by the stunning jean tripplehorn , who isn\'t given a chance to be stunning , or even interesting , by the mediocre and unimaginative script . \nthe child enola , played by tina majorino , is living proof that a child actor need not be a bad thing to have in a movie ; she outshines her material all the way through . \nin simple , the scene is earth , hundreds of years from now . \nthe polar ice caps have melted , and somehow produced enough water to inundate the entire planet . \nthe few remaining people live in boats and floating colonies , and survive by trade , theft , or piracy . \nsomehow an oil tanker has survived the centuries , and its inhabitants , called \" smokers , \" are able to keep gasoline engines running despite the dearth of replacement parts and raw materials , so the bad guys have outboard engines , and fast-moving boats , airplanes , and jet skis . \nenola , found at sea as a young girl , has a mysterious map no one can read tattooed on her back . \nwe suspect early on that it is the way to the mythical \" dryland , \" the place where trees , crops , and animals grow , and what plot there is hinges on who has enola . \nthe psycho ruler of the smokers , the \" deacon , \" is trying to get her and find his way to dryland . \nplayed with typical self-lampooning , rug-chewing histrionics by dennis hopper , \" deacon \" is the only thing in the movie that\'s close to amusing . \nhis performance is * almost * laughable , but there just isn\'t enough there to be funny . \nthe star ( and a co-producer ) is kevin costner . \nhe\'s playing an un-named lone denizen of the sea , a man called the \" mariner , \" who turns out to be a gilled , water-breathing mutant with webbed feet . \nvery little is done with this . \nthe script ignores the ineffectuality of gills in supplying enough oxygen to support a human metabolism ; it ignores the fact that even with both ice caps completely melted , much of the earth\'s surface would still be above water ; and it ignores the blatant impossibility of the cultures and technology shown . \n ( canned meat does * not * last for centuries ; ammunition does * not * fire after it\'s more than a few decades old ; and so on , and so on . . . ) \ni\'m quite fond of tina majorino\'s previous work , very impressed by jean tripplehorn\'s past accomplishments , and still speechless over costner\'s dances with wolves . \nbut this movie could destroy the careers of anyone associated with it ! \nthis movie cost one hundred and eighty-two million dollars , and there\'s * nothing * in it we haven\'t seen before , done better on only a few percent of the cost of this turkey . \nat 125 minutes of material , this movie cost over one point four million dollars per minute to make . \nthe budget of this movie * could * have given us over thirty movies ; it could have paid for six years of a prime-time sf tv series with expensive fx work , or ten years of an sf tv series with good digital fx . \nin sum , this movie is beneath contempt . \nit has nothing new to offer , it has a script that could easily have been bettered by the people who write comic books for dc , and it spent more money than the national budget of a small nation . \nif you * have * to go see it , see it on a four-dollar matinee . \notherwise you\'ll find yourself sneering at you every time you pass a reflective surface , for weeks . \n'~neg
'there\'s more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell . \nin how to make an american quilt , the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof ) , we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality . \nall the sorrows , joys , longings , sufferings , and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and , as their bittersweet memories are given expression , one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future . \nmotion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative . \nthe \" quilting bee \" consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith ) , a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons ) , the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan ) , who has been having an affair with emma\'s husband ; anna ( maya angelou ) , the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard ) , anna\'s daughter . \nthe project they\'re busy with is the wedding quilt for hy\'s granddaughter , finn ( winona ryder ) , who has just become engaged . \nshe\'s spending the summer with hy and gladys , and away from her fiance , to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants , and whether it\'s better to marry a friend or a lover . \none of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast . \nfrom winona ryder , ann bancroft , ellen burstyn , and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn , claire danes , and kate capshaw , this film is overflowing with realized talent . \nthe performances are good enough , in fact , to cover up many of the script\'s weaknesses . \nhow to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable , if affecting , tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club , with a dash of fried green tomatoes added . \nthere are probably too many characters . \nso , instead of really getting to know a few of them , we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives . \nwe learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy , and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible . \nthere are other episodes as well : the love of anna\'s life , marianna\'s soul mate , and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friend\'s husband . \nthe sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finn\'s story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger . \nthere is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt . \nthe stories are all well-told , but it\'s difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly . \nwhile we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals , our emotional investment is tenuous . \nthere isn\'t enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way , and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed , like a quilt with patches missing . \nto put it bluntly , while i enjoyed watching this film , it didn\'t \" do much \" for me . \non the whole , how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love , passion , and monogamy in relationships . \nfinn\'s segment is by far the most compelling , because she\'s the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone else\'s experiences . \nthe other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees . \nif there\'s a disappointment here , it\'s that the script doesn\'t have more resonance , but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional . \n'~pos
'this season needs another serial killer movie like kathie lee gifford needs more public devastation . \nbut lo and behold , here comes \" switchback , \" and fast on the heels of such stalker fare as \" kiss the girls \" and \" i know what you did last summer . \" \nbut \" switchback \" is an undoubtedly weak genre entry , as the material it covers is old and tired , and the filmmakers rarely sustain enough energy to make any of the proceedings interesting . \n \" switchback \" opens with the murder of a babysitter and the abduction of the young child she\'s watching . \nwe learn late in the game that the kid belongs to fbi agent frank lacrosse ( dennis quaid ) , and that the kidnapper/killer is a nameless fiend that lacrosse has been tracking across the country for quite a while . \nhe is promptly removed from the case , but this conflict of interest doesn\'t keep him from offering pursuit . \nlacrosse\'s most recent trek takes him to a blood-soaked hotel room in amarillo , texas , where the local sheriff ( r . lee ermey ) is torn between his re-election campaign and helping his new ally catch his man . \nin a related aside , former railway worker bob goodall ( danny glover ) is cruising through the snowbound west in his pinup-plastered ( even on the seatbelts ) el dorado . \nalong the way , he picks up -- and subsequently saves the life of -- hitchhiking loner lane dixon ( jared leto ) . \nthis tangent isn\'t a random one , as bob or lane will end up either holding a piece of the puzzle or turn out to be the killer himself . \nor is the villain in fact lacrosse , only pretending to be after the cold-hearted murderer he knows so much about . \nin a sense , that\'s half of the basic problem with \" switchback . \" \nfor its first hour , the movie presents evidence that any of these three men could be the perpetrator , so we\'re given little insight into who they are , likely for fear that we\'ll learn too much too fast and therefore be able to make the proper deduction . \nbut \" switchback \" then decides to explicitly reveal the killer\'s identity at its midpoint , and the following contradictory character motivations muddle both the pacing and the generation of suspense . \nsome of the acting is a burdensome area as well , probably because the performers were instructed to build personas that are the exact opposite of their true selves . \nwhat is danny glover doing here , grinning and yeehawing his way through the messy plot ? \nand dennis quaid ? \n ( that monotone -- stop it ! ) \nermey is solid in a supporting role that\'s more interesting than the two leads thrown together , but the charismatic leto ( claire danes\' object of affection in \" my so-called life \" ) is a scene-stealer tried and true . \n>from a material standpoint , \" switchback \" is pretty empty . \nbut even when first-time director jeb stuart ( who wrote \" the fugitive \" and \" die hard \" ) doesn\'t know what to do , he knows what he wants it to look like -- the movie provides some great visuals . \nthe set-on-a-train climax looks good ( even though the action is illogical ) , and the beautiful , crisp cinematography captures the rockies in all of their icy splendor . \nstill , that\'s not enough to turn a lump of coal into a diamond , and more than the movie\'s look will end up leaving you cold . \n'~neg

'i have to say it . \ntim burton\'s retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys . \nok , that\'s off my chest . \nno more monkey puns , i promise . \nseriously , though , planet of the apes is one rip-roarin\' summer outing , filled with thrills , action , adventure , wit and bits of funny ( dare i say , monkey ) business . \ni know , i know , i promised . \nand for those film buffs who are fond of the original , burton\'s version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie . \nmark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson , a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future . \nhe crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted , captured and sold into slavery . \ndespite being darker than the original , burton\'s film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious . \nsome of the movie\'s flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed . \nthen there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter . \nthe seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty : \" one thing you don\'t want in your house is a human teen-ager , \" he says . \nyou don\'t have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement . \ntouches such as these are what stamps this movie with burton\'s brand . \nlines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simian\'s foot to try righting himself are : \" take your stinking hand off of me , you damned , dirty human . \" \nanyone familiar with the first version of the film will , of course , recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue . \nanother of burton\'s in-jokes is to have charlton heston , star of the original , play the chimpanzee father of tim roth\'s gen . thade . \nthe young chimp goes to visit his dying father . \nboth have one thing in common , a hatred of humans . \nwith his dying breath , the elder spews out his vile : \" damn them , damn them all to hell , \" he says before expiring . \nthat is the famous line heston\'s taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planet\'s terrible secret . \nthe performances throughout are top-notch . \nwahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero , but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home . \nhe is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet . \nthis hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable . \nroth is ferocious , cunning , cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity . \nhe leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet . \nit is a masterful turn . \nhelena bonham carter is ari , the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals . \nhers is a smart , compassionate characterization . \nmichael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken . \na fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo , the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures . \nas the battle between apes and humans looms , the cowardly limbo pleads , \" can\'t we all just get along , \" echoing the words of rodney king . \nmuch of the success of planet of the apes goes to burton\'s technical crew , especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup . \nburton\'s musical collaborator , danny elfman , provides another fine score , though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow . \nthe movie\'s only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original . \nhe comes close , but falls short . \notherwise , planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action , stunts and a few laughs . \nthis is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype . \n'~pos

'urban legend surprised me . \nbased on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer , disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 ) , i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena . \nthankfully , legend rose above it\'s soggy premise to become not only a hip , scary and stylish entertainment , but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year . \nyou\'re all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac who\'s identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be , you guessed it ; everybody\'s favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the \nonly person you didn\'t suspect ! \nhowever , just because legend doesn\'t really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it can\'t qualify as first-class entertainment . \nit was , believe it or not , one of the funnest times i\'ve had at the movies all year . \nthe thing is , i\'m not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive . \nmaybe it was the above-par performances by the movie\'s two leads ( jared leto and \" cybil \" actress alicia witt ) . \nor , it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks . \nmore likely , though , it was because of the inspired premise . \ni don\'t think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman . \nurban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener , not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film . \na pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill . \none problem , though . \nwould you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ? \ni thought not . \npredictably , the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company . \nit\'s odd , though , when you pick up a phone to realize that nobody\'s on the other line . \nnaturally , the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off . \nand the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! ! \na decapitation . \nit turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car . \nso who is it this time ? \nthe obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself , robert englund ) , who teaches a class on urban legends . \na-ha . \nor could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ? \nlike all movies of this nature , one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit . \nand it turns out to be , of course , the one you didn\'t suspect . \ni\'m not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is , but i must give credit where credit is due . \nand this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun . \n * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi , ca \n'~pos
'susan granger\'s review of \" ghosts of mars \" ( sony pictures entertainment ) \nhorror auteur john carpenter ( \" halloween , \" \" vampires \" ) strikes out with this sci-fi eco-fable that\'s so bad it boggles the mind to imagine how the project ever got green-lit . \nthe script by carpenter and larry sulkis appears to have been lifted directly from last year\'s \" pitch black , \" involving a violent prisoner who must be released from bondage so that he can help a small band of humans protect themselves from blood-thirsty , marauding aliens . \nin the year 2176 , there are 640 , 000 earthlings on mars , living in a matriarchal society led by a commander , played by pam grier . \ngrier , pill-poppin\' natasha henstridge , and some rookie mars police officers ( clea duvall , jason statham ) travel to the remote mining town of shining canyon to fetch \" desolation \" williams - that\'s ice cube - to bring him back to chryse city to stand trial for murder . \nbut when they\'re besieged by demented , zombie-like , body-snatching miners , they readily free the scowling ice cube since they need him for protection . \nit seems a red cloud was released from a shining canyon cave and , soon after , most of the miners went bonkers as long-dormant remnants of an ancient martian civilization took over their minds and bodies , lopping off heads as \" vengeance for anything that tries to lay claim to their planet , \" according to a scientist ( joanna cassidy ) . \ncarpenter uses so many flashbacks to tell the \" night of the living dead \" -like story that the idiotic plot gets incomprehensibly confusing . \nbut you can easily predict each of the supporting characters who will be killed , along with the order of their elimination . \non the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10 , \" ghosts of mars \" thuds to a laborious , bottom-of-the-barrel 1 . \nperhaps , indeed , there is a curse on mars films , if you recall two other duds : \" mission to mars \" and \" red planet . \" \n'~neg

'the love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any man\'s life , especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances . \nthematically in cinema , love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare , however , for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benigni\'s neo-classic drama , life is beautiful . \nthrough a central cast of father , mother , and son , benigni demonstrates the wonderful , undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times . \nlife * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni , directing himself here for the sixth time in his career ) , an italian jew , master con man , and aspiring waiter extraordinaire . \nliving in 1930\'s italy , he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) . \nalthough dora is already engaged , guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) . \nunfortunately for the happy family , the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps . \nit is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movie\'s theme of family love becomes the strongest . \nalthough prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm , he relaxes the role to ensure his son\'s happiness . \nnow , instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora , he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right . \nbenigni\'s performance is truly a well-rounded one , and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year . \nthe supports are all strong as well , but the movie truly excels in its script . \nlife is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable , one which tells its story in grand , two-part fashion . \nin certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a \" saturday night live \" spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movie\'s second half the script\'s circular nature becomes admirably obvious . \ncharacters make reprise appearances in fine form , and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plot\'s outcome . \nin all , fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture , and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first \" artsy \" film . \nlife is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone , and above all is a fine thematic picture . \n'~pos

'while watching wes anderson\'s rushmore , it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer , the film\'s anti-hero , was not written with jason schwartzman in mind . \nthe young actor , making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman . \nschwartzman plays max , a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like \" serpico \" and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result . \non the brink of being thrown out , he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmore\'s baseball field ) in her honour . \nunfortunately for everyone involved , blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well , which gets in the way of max\'s plans to woo her . \nmax is one of the best-written characters we\'ve yet seen in the 90s , and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age . \nas everyone else has probably already pointed out , he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from \" the wonder years \" , from a visual standpoint , at least ) . \nhopefully , if he avoids typecasting as weird , quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career . \nbill murray is his equal as blume , displaying a depth we haven\'t yet seen from him . \nwhile this isn\'t his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here . \nwilliams isn\'t given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray , but still does fine work . \nrushmore seems to go just a little too long but , while it isn\'t a perfect film , it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity , an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality . \nanderson has created a modern classic with a star who should , with any luck , rise to even greater success . \n'~pos
'about an hour or so into \" the jackal , \" a character wandered around as people were being shot at in a big suspense sequence , and one of the audience members in the theatre i saw it in shouted out \" i hope she gets killed now ! \" \nat that point it hit me : i didn\'t care for any of the characters being played by actors i didn\'t really like . \nwhen the sole reason you care about a character being played by sidney poitier in a suspense film is because he\'s being played by sidney poitier , you know something\'s rotten in the state of denmark . \nevery year , a couple films like this are released . \nyou know : the cheap , action packed international espionnage film , featuring a semi-promising premise , some big-name actors ( usually bruce willis ) , and the hopes that some audience members will forget the cold war ended several years ago . \nthis was the third one of \'97 , following the very lackluster \" the saint , \" which featured an amoral costume changing bond wannabe ; and the surprisingly fun \" the peacemaker , \" featuring clooney and kidman trying to stop an almost untraceable villain . \n \" the jackal \" tries to mix both elements . \nand you thought \" the saint \" was bad . \n \" the jackal \" is loosely ( very loosely , i hope ) based on the 1973 fred zimmerman classic that i\'ve yet to see , \" the day of the jackal , \" which featured ( apparently ) a suave hitman called the jackal , played by edward fox , trying to assasinate charles degaule . \nwell , welcome to the 90s , where a sorta suave hitman , also called the jackal ( bruce willis ) , trying to kill the head of the fbi . . . or \nis he ?

\nis it a film about a nasty , amoral hitman who\'s in everything for the money ? \nor is it a combination of both ? \n \" the jackal \" aims for the latter , but never focuses in on either character . \nthe connection between the two feels completely edited , so much that in a scene when the jackal turns around and notices declan , you wonder how he recognized him so fast . \nthe worst part is the little past they try to give declan , most notably his relationship with an old girlfriend , isabella ( mathilda may ) , given so little screen time that you almost forget her character exists until she pops up every now and then . \nthe supporting characters are worse . \nsidney poitier is given a completely unplayable role , that of a man who is just stern sometimes , and other times more giving and likable . \nwhat is poitier doing here ? \nhe\'s one of the best living actors ! \ndoes he really need to waste his time doing drivel like this ? \ndiane venora\'s russian character is almost as bad , with a cigarette perpetually in her mouth , and a plastered on expressionless facade . \nit\'s not that anyone\'s bad here ; it\'s that they have nothing to do . \nthe plot is a joke , feeling like it was pasted together by someone in post-production who dropped each scene on the floor and pasted them together quickly so it could be released on time . \nthe jackal himself is not even much of an international villain . \nthere are several times where he\'s in a tight situation and makes things worse for himself , the only explanation being that the filmmakers wanted to toss in a cheap thrill . \ntake a scene where he\'s being followed by some agents into a parking garage : he quickly sprays his car another color , and adds a solvent that if touched kills the person who touched it . \ndoesn\'t killing someone attract more attention than it does distract ? \nand does he think dying his hair bottle blond makes him fit in in a public place ? \ngeez ! \nis there anything good here ? \nwell . . . a \ncouple things . \ni did like willis\'s icy expressions ; he may not have been real suave or anything , but some of his looks are worth a chuckle . \nrichard gere has a couple of good moments , making his character as likable as he possibly could have . \nand a couple sequences are kicky in that kind of proposterous , completely inane but fun kinda way , most notably : a sequence where he tests out a new gun on an annoying gun builder ( jack black ) ; and a bit where he seduces a gay washington man , which has its share of a couple good jokes , most particular a kiss by willis . \nbut none of these elevate the film any higher than it could go ; they\'re just little distractions along the way to amuse us mildly then toss us back into the world of dullness and stupidity that is \" the jackal . \" \ndirector michael caton-jones ( who directed the far superior \" rob roy \" ) has made a film that is made very couple months , one that is unentertaining , unintriguing , and pretty much cold , but will nevertheless make money because , hey , the trailers do make it look like it may be fun in that kind of retro-clancy kinda way . \nevery now and then , the filmmakers get it right ( \" clear and present danger , \" which was enormous fun in that smart kinda way ) , but \" the jackal \" is an example of when they go completely wrong . \n'~neg
'no , i did not read the novel by thomas hardy , \" jude the obscure , \" his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life . \nbut , after watching the movie , i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is . \n \" jude \" is a satirical film from start to finish about society\'s way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system , but what\'s remarkable is how timeless this film is . \nthe film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasn\'t really sure ) , but its story could even be retold today in modern form , although it\'d be kinda different ( a given ) . \nit tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from \" shallow grave \" ) - a simple , dim-witted young man with big dreams . \nin its bleak , foreboding opening , shot in grainy black and white , he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham ) , his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain , looking upon a city in the distance , he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world . \nafter marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common , he moves away to a town with a giant university , with a chance to learn more , and get ahead in life . \ntaking a welding job , he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars , reciting latin over and over again , and training himself . \nbut when he sends his application for the school in , he is bluntly told to just remain a worker . \nanother reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet ) , his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher . \nshe and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends , so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school ) , there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) . \nseveral twists turn in the storyline , and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene , to say the least . . . ) , and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock , as she eventually gives birth to their baby , and jude inherits his son from arabella , who turns up again after awhile . \nbecause they aren\'t married , and because they\'re cousins , they run into problems with every place they go to , carrying around two children everywhere , and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time , then moving on . \nif you didn\'t think this was harsh enough , wait till you see what happens later on . . . \nthe sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world . \nhe will never gain any true happiness , and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting , and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life . \npart of it is his fault - he\'s too optimistic , and too gullible . \nbut society has a way of taking these people , and hurting them until their death . \nthe ending of \" jude \" is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess i\'ll have to read it now ) . \n \" jude \" offers a satirical view on society\'s cruelties , but shows no way of curing this , and thank heavens it doesn\'t . \nthere\'s no way to relinquish the selfishness of society , and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem . \nsatire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain people\'s minds , and that\'s what \" jude \" is . \nsure , it\'s one hell of a downer , but it needs to be . \nthe film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads , and some good supporting work along with it . \nchristopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully , sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face , and making him kind of child-like at other times . \nkate winslet , in a pre- \" titanic \" performance , is brilliant , nailing every psyche of her character , and creating someone who\'s troubled but very seductive with her personality . \nkate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you don\'t believe me , see \" titanic , \" branagh\'s \" hamlet , \" \" sense and sensibility , \" and \" heavenly creatures , \" the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) . \nin the supporting roles , liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher , exposing all his bad parts , but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as jude\'s wife , whom he never divorces . \n \" jude \" moves at a very slow pace , and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists , which would drive some people nuts . \nbut those who appreciate good social commentary with their films , no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate \" jude , \" though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it . \n'~pos
' \" showgirls \" is the first big-budget , big-studio film to receive an nc-17 rating . \nand its release last year came at a time when senator bob dole and other politicans chastised the entertainment industry for promoting sex and violence . \nbut if \" showgirls \" is any indication of hollywood\'s future , the folks in washington should focus their attack on a more dangerous threat to american values--bad moviemaking . \n \" showgirls \" is a relentlessly exploitive look at the las vegas strip scene , and the film turns out to be just as trashy as its subject matter . \ndirector paul verhoeven and writer joe eszterhas , who collaborated on another shock-value project , 1992\'s \" basic instinct , \" follow the plight of a young woman ( teen tv star elizabeth berkley ) determined to make a name for herself as a topless dancer . \nit\'s a hackneyed premise to begin with , so not surprisingly , all of the stock characters are trucked out . \nthere\'s the demanding producer . \nthe loyal friend . \nthe bitchy competitor . \nlest i forget the scummy club owner . \nof course , any attempt at character development or a coherent storyline is just window dressing for the film\'s main attraction--an endless parade of full-frontal nudity . \nunfortunately , \" showgirls \" doesn\'t satisfy in this department . \nverhoeven\'s slam-bang , in-your-face style of direction proves neither arousing nor erotic . \nto make matters worse , you\'ll be forced to sit through the movie\'s clothed scenes , which don\'t cover up for laughable acting and some of the most absurd dialogue ever spoken in film history . \nverhoeven and ezsterhas deserve credit for trying to break ground , but if it\'s adult entertainment you want , stay home and watch the playboy channel . \nyou\'ll be the wiser for it . \n'~neg

'here\'s a concept -- jean-claude van damme gets killed within the first ten minutes of the movie . \nnow if that isn\'t enough to get you to finally see a van damme movie , i don\'t know what is . \nall sarcasm aside , it is certainly a different way to start a movie , of course a few minutes later we find out that the newly deceased had a twin brother -- so lucky us , we get to see more of jean-claude . \nvan damme #1 works for the russian mafia in the united states and is killed by some of their operatives . \nvan damme #2 is a police officer in france who finds out that he had a twin brother he never knew about after #1 gets killed in france . \nthe remaining twin ( the french cop ) goes to the united states to find out who killed his brother and avenge his death . \nonce there , he hooks up with his deceased brother\'s girlfriend , played by natasha henstridge , and the two of them set out to discover who the murderers are . \njean-claude\'s acting abilities don\'t seem to be up to the usual lackluster standards in this movie . \nin other words , just in case you missed the sarcasm , his acting is worse than normal . \non the upside , natasha henstridge is in this film , and she does what she did best in species -- she gets naked . \nsadly , this is probably the high point in the movie . \nshe is actually a decent actress , but didn\'t improve as much as i thought she would after species . \nthis is the typical van damme movie , with jean-claude doing a variety of high end martial arts moves on his opponents . \nnothing new here , and certainly nothing we haven\'t seen in every other van damme movie . \nsimply put , there is absolutely nothing new about this movie . \nit has a retread plot -- this isn\'t the first time jean-claude has played twins . \nhe still can\'t act . \nwe all saw natasha\'s breasts in species ( although this is one repeat performance i\'m not complaining about ) . \nthis is pretty much like every movie that van damme has ever been involved in -- sub par . \n'~neg
'it has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters . \nhis new film , the thin red line , is a strange , beautiful , enigmatic mess of a movie . \nthe first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast . \nit is filled with above-the-title stars . \nthe cast , for the most part , gives great performances . \njohn travolta , whose role is nothing more than a cameo , seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve . \ngeorge clooney , whose role became a cameo in editing , gives a strange performance . \none wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a character\'s narration . \nthe rest of the cast , especially nick nolte and elias koteas , are unambiguously fantastic . \nthese actors ( and they are , with two exceptions , men ) were lured by the name of malick . \nterrence malick is a cinematic legend . \nhe has often been called \" the j . d . salinger of cinema . \" \nhis two previous films , badlands and days of heaven , are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures . \nafter he made them , he disappeared for 20 years . \nthis film marks his return . \nwhat he\'s made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment . \nthe narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate , but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as \" i\'m scared . \" \nthe rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted . \nthe plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill . \na plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult , because the story is fractured . \nmany stories are here , from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going . \nthe fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault . \nit is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box , shook the box , and poured the results onto a table . \nthis basically creates a mess , but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed . \ni\'m not declaring that the film has no structure . \nwhile saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot , malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat . \nthe battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking . \nthe astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice . \nthis film uses color and light in such a fantastic way , that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video . \nultimately , malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them . \nthe film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature . \nwhile some have said that the anti-war message and pro-nature tubthumping was juvenile , it was done with so much complexity and thought , that it cannot ever honestly be called childish . \nafter seeing the thin red line , i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again . \n'~pos
'what makes reindeer games even more disappointing than just a predictable , lifeless action flick is the cast and crew who signed onto the project . \nmost of the people involved in reindeer games just came off terrible slumps with excellent comeback performances in their most recent films . \njohn frankenheimer , who made the unforgettable cold war drama the manchurian candidate way back in the early 60\'s , recently showed critics and fans alike that he still had some magic left in his directorial skills when he created the brilliant car chase scenes in ronin . \nscreenwriter ehren kruger gave a remarkable first impression when he wrote the script for the underrated arlington rd . \nben affleck displayed his comedic talents in dogma and boiler room , and even on saturday night live directly after the horrible forces of nature and 200 cigarettes . \neven charlize theron , who i was convinced couldn\'t act , did a decent job in cider house rules . \nwhen all of these bright stars come together , one would assume that the movie will have great potential to be entertaining . \nafter coming out of the theater showing reindeer games , disbelief was my first reaction ? then frustration . \nthe movie could have premiered on cinemax at two in the morning starring an all-rookie cast and still would have been equally lacking in entertaining . \nthe acting is so pitiful and the script so dull , i may have to rethink some of my opinions on how talented these actors actually are . \nit seemed like everyone was restricted to just the script and not given a fair amount of improvisational rights . \nwe have all seen ben affleck have some fun on the set , it is so apparent in a number of scenes in good will hunting when he exchanges jokes with his friends at a bar . \nthe actors in that movie were having fun and , from that , the audience had fun . \nreindeer games is the complete opposite ; the actors don\'t seem to want to be their characters ( even danny trejo , who will do practically anything , doesn\'t look like he is enjoying himself ) , causing the audience to quickly lose interest . \nevidence of public disapproval was noted when a woman behind me yelled \" boy this movie is horrible ! \" \nand when there were scattered giggles during the most dramatic moments . \nthe story follows a man , rudy ( ben affleck ) , who is leaving prison in a few days along with his best friend and cellmate nick ( james frain ) . \nnick has been exchanging love letters with a beautiful woman , ashley ( charlize theron ) , and cannot wait to leave prison and meet her in person . \nwhen nick is killed in a prison riot , rudy decides to pretend to be nick and take ashley out on a date for the christmas holidays . \nunfortunately ashley\'s brother , gabriel ( gary sinise ) interferes with their relationship . \nthinking rudy is nick , he kidnaps rudy and threatens to kill him unless he helps rob a casino , which nick use to work at as a security guard . \nnow rudy must pretend to be nick so he can protect ashley from her brother gabriel . \nconfused ? \nthe movie only gets more complex as it goes on , until it gets way , way too complex at its climax . \nbut reindeer games makes its first serious mistake during the first half an hour . \nthe hero commits a greedy , selfish act when he decides to pretend he is his dead cellmate in order to date ashley . \nsome hero . \nthe point of a hero is to do the morally correct thing , a person for the audience to relate to or admire . \nwhen rudy lies and cheats his way into trouble , instead of gathering support from me for him to ultimately succeed in getting the bad guys , i felt more like he was getting what he deserved and even wanted to see him fail at times . \nthe most irritating part of the film ( besides the fact that this is a christmas movie released in february ) is the number of chances the bad guys get to kill rudy but fail or delay for some idiotic reason . \nthe routine in which the bad guy must explain his genius plan to the hero before attempting to kill him with some elaborate machine is getting so tired nowadays , especially when i eagerly want to see the hero dead . \nthe only saving grace keeping this movie from receiving zero stars is an amusing but pointless cameo from isaac hayes as a prisoner upset with his food . \nwhy he was in this movie for such a pointless role beats me . \nwhy any of these people had anything at all to do with this movie beats me . \n'~neg

' ( dreamworks skg ) running time : 2 hours starring robert duvall , tea leoni and elijah wood directed by mimi leder the first of the two asteroid movies coming out this year ( the second is the macho armageddon ) is actually a dull affair . \nelijah wood plays leo biederman , who during astronomy class discovers that a large asteroid is heading for earth . \ntea leoni plays a ( rather crap ) news reporter , jenny lerner , who soon discovers about this asteroid through a very long winded and boring way , and robert duvall plays the leader of a space crew , spurgeon tanner , who are planning to blow the asteroid out of the path of earth . \nalso featuring is morgan freeman as the president , and maximilian schell and vanessa redgrave as jenny\'s father and mother . \nwhile many people will walk into the film expecting a big special effects fest with the asteroid blowing everything up ( as the trailers seem to promise ) , the film is actually more of a character study , if a very poor one . \nthe main problem is that there are too many characters in the film , and not enough time to explore them all . \nonly the space crew are given any depth , jenny lerner , leo and the president are surprisingly 2d , and we never get to know these characters . \nand because i couldn\'t care for them , i didn\'t really give a crap if the asteroid killed them or not . \nthe script by bruce joel rubin and michael tolkin is horribly simple , and never really makes any interesting statements . \nmimi leder , the former er director and director of the average the peacemaker ( 1996 ) , again directs in a ho-hum style , and never really gets any emotion out of a scene , which is a shame . \nthe cast are seemingly on autopilot , although tea leoni does gives a rather good performance , even if she acts a bit too dorky for her own good . \nshe seems uncommonly stupid for a journalist . \nrobert duvall is on autopilot with a underwritten role , he just seems to be in this film for the money . \nelijah wood , one of the best child actors working today , is surprisingly average , although his choice of roles lately haven\'t exactly been brilliant ( i . e . \nflipper , 1996 ) . \nhis role is also vastly underwritten . \nmorgan freeman , again , is utterly wasted with a ridiculously underwritten role . \nlike duvall , he just seems to be in the film for the money . \nthe supporting cast are all o . k , none making much of an impression . \nok , so deep impact may have messed up character wise , but surely the special effects are good ? \nwell , yes and no . \nalthough the special effects should be impressive , with a massive tidal wave destroying new york , the special effects look like , well , special effects . \nsadly , the waves looks like it\'s been drawn on computer , and doesn\'t look too good at all . \nsurprising really , when the effects are done by industrial light & magic , who did the effects for the lost world and twister . \nin the end , deep impact is a wasted opportunity . \nwhat could of been a moving movie with good effects turns out to be a dud in both characters and effects . \nthe 2 hours the film had could have been used to much greater effect . \nonce again , dreamworks has churned out another average movie . \nlet\'s hope armageddon is a bit better . \noverall rating= review by david wilcock web space provided by geocities \n'~neg
'as with his other stateside releases , jackie chan\'s latest chopsocky vehicle , mr . nice guy , is contrived , blockheaded , and lacking in narrative logic . \nbut also like those other films , it is a highly enjoyable ride . \nonce again , chan\'s screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their star\'s character simply jackie , with no last name . \nthis jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television . \nof course , jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist , and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporter\'s ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring . \nother plot details , involving a videotape and a biker gang , are irrelevant ; in fact , as is the case with most chan films , the plot itself is just about irrelevant . \nthe sole purpose of mr . nice guy\'s existence are chan\'s comic fight scenes , and those here do not disappoint . \ndirector samo hung ( who has a cameo role ) , a longtime collaborator of chan\'s , does not waste any time putting chan in action , diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue . \nother impressive set pieces follow , most notably a chase in a mall , which directly leads to some frenzied , if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? ) , business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site , in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards , cement mixers , and a deadly buzzsaw . \nnone of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercop\'s thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronx\'s daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor , respectively . \nbut the action delivers , even if the energy peters out before the film\'s end ( the finale , as spectacular as it is , is a letdown for fans of chan\'s athletic prowess ) . \nfilmed almost entirely in english ( even so , the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed ) , mr . nice guy hints at jackie chan\'s latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980\'s the big brawl and 1985\'s the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour , a stateside production co-starring chris tucker . \nhopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown , and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy , for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands , much like they have been before . \n'~pos
'seen may 2 , 1998 at 3 : 40 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 , theater #13 , with chris wessell and sean o\'shea for $5 . \n[theater rating : * * * 1/2 : very good sound , picture , and seats] \nthe big-budget , mega-hype \" event \" movie is becoming so trendy now it is becoming a weekly routine instead of a seasonal one . \ngluttony is hollywood\'s favorite sin , but it is the movie-goers who pay the price by being dealt the same things over and over on an ever-worsening basis . \n \" lost in space \" is the latest such offering - a film so poor it would be twice as good if it were mediocre . \nit\'s made up of every element of science fiction , but at no time does it evoke the slightest amount of wonderment the genre was meant for . \naudiences\' attention spans are rapidly decreasing and as is the trend with such films , this one opens with a fast-paced space battle which serves not only as the most interesting scene in the film ( probably because it has \" star wars \" written all over it ) , but as the producers\' way of showing off their budget through the special effects . \nbattle scenes are worthless without tension , and since we have no idea what the setting is it\'s impossible to care about anything that happens . \nin essence , the entire segment works like a teaser for an arcade game , not a piece of filmmaking . \nwe meet the robinson family - a family of five that does not get along but has been chosen to act on earth\'s behalf in effort to find another planet worthy of colonization due to the exhausting of our natural resources . \neach member of the family has a special trait and personality , and yet none of them seem like actual people . \nprofessor john robinson ( hurt ) is the intelligent , quiet leader who has devoted so much time to his work his family and marriage are suffering without his realizing it ( it\'s obvious what role this aspect will play ) . \nof course this is all established through extremely melodramatic scenes such as the children and parents arguing and bickering among themselves and with each other , while the necessary problems are \" resolved \" at the right moments . \nthe only thing worse than the screenplay is the fact it\'s presented in a completely serious manner without a trace of satire , and is so pathetic it\'s laughable . \nthe first act is not a building of a story , but a juxtaposition of scenes that serve no purpose other than to plug in all the required elements ( such as plot , conflict , and characterization - god forbid ! ) . \nwe\'re provided with the minimum amount possible of these elements to keep the film from being completely silent . \nin fact , it might as well be since the dialogue is virtually non-existent . \nyes , the characters do speak , but they do not talk . \nthey say things that only relate to the conflict , but they never really interact ( unless it\'s the cartoony flirting scenes between arrogant major don west ( leblanc ) and uptight , unemotional judy robinson ( graham ) ) . \nit\'s amazing that after an hour of trite dialogue and generic plot devices that so little happens . \neventually the pacing rapidly increases , but the amount of genuine interest does not . \nthe story finally gains some prospective by living up to its title as the robinsons find themselves lost in space after narrowly managing to defeat dr . smith ( oldman ) , the cartoony villain , and his plans for sabotage . \nwhat ensues is a series upon series of completely unrelated conflicts . \nthe first such scene takes place on an abandoned spaceship and what ensues could best be described as \" alien \" -lite . \nthe story changes again when the robinsons crash land on an alien planet and must act quickly to escape it and survive . \nbut there\'s never any real notion of suspense here because the script constantly wanders aimlessly . \nplotlines are developed , but each becomes totally irrelevant as the story changes from scenario to scenario . \nthe atmosphere attempts to be surreal by incorporating time travel and various time paradoxes , but it\'s presented in such a ridiculous way it\'s utterly boring . \nby the time the last act rolls around , there is no sense of a payoff building . \nthe ending does not go out on a high note with any kind of climax , instead , it seems to come to a sudden halt ( but at least it ends at all ) . \n \" lost in space \" is major film production at its worst . \nit\'s frightening that a film so poorly written , directed , and acted might be considered mainstream entertainment . \n'~neg
'the premise of wag the dog is so simple that it\'s adequately explained by the commercials . \nwith 11 days to go until the election , the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal . \ndeniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a \" pageant \" , a phony war against albania , fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville , with woody harrelson as the reluctant , psychotic hero . \nand if there wasn\'t anything more to the movie than this , it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best , enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington . \n ( a heist comedy ? \nyup . \ndeniro and hoffman are \" stealing \" the election , so to speak , and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . ) \nwag the dog succeeds because it\'s based one great truth : the american people are stupid . \nok , maybe it\'s not \" love thy neighbor as thyself \" or even \" two plus two makes four \" , but a truth nonetheless . \n ( any average person who thinks that they\'re really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited , nay , challenged , to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . ) \nand because we\'re so utterly , predictably stupid , hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo , washington knows that we won\'t notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniro\'s character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we won\'t be able to locate albania on the map . \nthe beauty of wag the dog is that it isn\'t a light , meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless , the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness . \nnor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived , ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes , i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out , thanks for asking ) . \ninstead , david mamet\'s script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire . \nit does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers\' schemes come off beautifully , and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion . \ndeniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables , without any of the violent rages . \nit\'s all : \" what do i love ? \nwhat is it that brings me joy ? \nbaseball , \" minus the savage bloody beating with the bat . \nhe threatens a lot of people , mind you , but he\'s doing it in a very nice , polite way . \nit\'s a very mellow , restrained performance , which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script . \nhoffman , on the other hand , is giddy , exuberant and joyous . \nthis kind of thing is what his character lives for , and he\'s so excited that he can\'t even shut up . \neven on the edge of disaster , he\'s bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive . \ninsiders note that he\'s basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true , but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have . \nthe best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast . \nthe characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them , listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue , get to know them better -- which we don\'t . \nanne heche , is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside , panicked and frenzied on the outside . \ndenis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the \" fad king \" , who handles the profitable \" back-end \" -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative , innovative ways to separate a fool from his money . \nthey could make a whole movie , just about the fad king , and i\'d go see it . \nwillie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously , from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song , to the weepy country waltz , to the hilarious \" ballad of the green berets \" parody . \nwoody harrelson has a brief , but memorable part as the overmedicated \" hero \" of the albanian conflict . \ncraig t . nelson , as the opposition candidate , and the ever-reliable william h . macy , as a wacky cia agent , are given surprisingly short shrift . \n ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . ) \nwag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics , the role of the press in dumbing down the issues , the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials , the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on . \nwe can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens . \nwag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we don\'t . \n'~pos
'the only thing worse than watching a bad movie is realizing that the film had a lot of potential and could\'ve been effective . \nsuch is the case with _urban legend_ , the new horror film from first time director jamie blanks . \nthe idea behind the movie is that the mad slasher of the film muders people according to various urban legends . \nexamples include the killer in the backseat of the car and person getting calls from inside her house . \nthe killer wears one of those l . l . bean parkas with the hood drawn completely up , so you can\'t see the face . \ni guess halloween masks are out of style for psychos these days . \nanyhow , the premise is certainly a nifty one and the opening scene is spooky and atmospheric . \nit\'s a very good setup that promises more chills to come . \nunfortunately , the film never takes off from there . \nthe movie takes place on a peaceful new england college campus . \nlike most slasher flicks , this one also centers around a young female main character whose friends are slowly killed off by a knife wielding maniac ( or in this case an axe wielding maniac ) . \ni\'ve always wondered why these killers don\'t save themselves a lot of time and trouble and just go after the person they ultimately aim to kill . \nafter the fine first scene , the movie degenerates into a monotonous series of those annoying you-thought-it-was-the-killer-but-was-just- someone-else scares . \nthese are always accompanied by loud bursts of music . \ni guess sudden , sharp music chords are what passes for terror these days . \nthe actual killer will attack at about every third music blast . \nthe slasher appears , attacks , the victim is eviscerated , and the tedious cycle appears anew . \nfalse scares should always be used in moderation . \nsomeone needs to tell director blanks that things like this just aren\'t as scary as they used to be . \nthis movie commits the biggest sin a horror film can commit--it\'s not frightening . \nremember the horror movie cliches that were so mercilessly mocked in _scream_ and _scream 2_ ? \nthis movie still adheres to them . \ntons of illogical moments about ; more than i really have the inclination to list . \nand i don\'t mean illogical in the summer popcorn movie sense . \nthat type of illogical can be fun . \nthis film insults your intelligence more times than i care to remember . \nthe last 20 minutes especially degenerates into such lunacy that you\'ll be laughing more than you\'ll be screaming . \nactually , you won\'t be screaming at all . \nat its best , the acting can barely be called \" adequate \" and the script could\'ve definitely used a rewrite or two . \nthe film still manages to have some strong points . \nthe killings are certainly inventive and plentiful enough to satistfy most gore fans . \nthere are some intentionally funny moments . \n ( these were exceeded by the unintentional ones . ) \nthe film is well made from a technical standpoint . \nbesides the first part , there is also another good scene , a prolonged cat and mouse chase inside a radio station . \nif there had only been more sequences like this , that relied on tautness and suspense rather than loud bursts of music , _urban legend_ might\'ve been worth your money . \n'~neg
'as the film opens up , expectant unwed mother sally ( played by drew barrymore ) encounters her baby\'s father in a fast food drive-through window . \nafter he gets his milkshake , he drives off , only to be pursued by a military helicopter . \nfrom this moment forward , you know that this isn\'t going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy . \nhome fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian ( played by luke wilson ) , a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally . . . more \nthan he would care to admit ( hint : it has something to do with the father of sally\'s unborn child ) . \nafter taking a personal ( and professional ) interest in her , he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works , and the fun goes on from there . \nthis movie is a lot of fun . \nit is comedic on two levels , as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy . \nthe romantic moments are sweet , yet not sappy . \none of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes . \nhowever , the dark comedic moments are more memorable . \nthis is also a tale of revenge , and a funny one at that . \nthe father of sally\'s unborn child also happened to be a married man , whose wife is played by catherine o\'hara . \nshe does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair , and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work . \n ( my apologies if this sounds cryptic , but there is too much of the plot to give away ) . \nrounding out the cast are jake busey as angus , dorian\'s overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy , dorian\'s trainer at the fast food restaurant . \nthe dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones , even with the romantic nature of the plot . \nif there are any complaints , it is over drew barrymore\'s performance . \nwhile she does light up the screen , there are moments when she doesn\'t seem all that convincing . \nthe movie was filmed in texas , and most of the characters have southern texan accents . \ndrew barrymore\'s accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesn\'t seem to have this problem ) . \nas well , she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant . \nstill , this movie is one that will please many viewers . \nwith plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments , this is sure to entertain . \n'~pos
'my opinion on a film can be easily swayed by the presence of actors i love . \ni love ralph fiennes . \ni love uma thurman . \ni love sean connery . \nhell , i\'m even a big fan of jim broadbent and fiona shaw . \ni saw the fantastic preview for the avengers nearly eight months ago , and i\'ve been eagerly awaiting the film ever since . \na few months into the summer , however , i noticed that its release date had been changed a few times , and that it had ended up in the mid-august dumping ground . \nthen , in this final week before its official release , i learned that it was not to be screened for critics . \nand that the actors had not been plugging the film on late night programs . \nand that it was directed by the same man who brought us the remake of diabolique . \nmy expectations fell to pieces when i learned all of these things . \nthe film i saw today didn\'t even meet those expectations . \nthis is a lousy , incoherent mess . \ni would slam it harder , if it weren\'t for the nifty sets and the mere presence of all these fine , lovable actors . \nbut sets are ultimately empty , and the performances are completely uninspired . \nthat\'s the main problem with the avengers : for all it\'s hip-hop flash and tidal waves , none of it feels the least bit energetic or inspired . \nit\'s like a chore , a bland exercise in superhero film making . \nit also feels like its been cut to pieces , clocking in at 90 minutes and forgetting to close some of its own subplots . \nthis is just plain depressing . \nthe avengers is a film version of the popular 60s television show . \nfrequent readers of mine will not be surprised to learn that i\'ve never watched an episode . \ni wasn\'t alive then . \ni don\'t even watch television now . \ni\'m very sorry that i don\'t have this perspective , but , judging from the reviews i\'ve already read , knowing the tv show just makes matters worse . \ni didn\'t know and love john steed and emma peel , and therefore i was not as upset to see how these actors i love have managed to thrash their roles . \ni also doubt that familiarity with the series would allow me to understand more clearly the chain of events that do take place in this film . \nbased on what the film told me , i gather that steed ( fiennes ) is some kind of british super guy ( somewhat like james bond ) , and that dr . peel ( thurman ) is just a really smart doctor , who also happens to know a lot about weather and about beating people up while limited by tight leather suits . \nthey are to work together , under mother\'s orders ( mother is played by jolly jim broadbent , while his co-conspirator , father , is played by the equally-talented fiona shaw ) . \nit seems that there is a man out there controlling the weather . \nhis name is de wynter ( connery ) . \nhe is a crazy scottish guy . \nour heroes had better stop him , or else . \n . \n . \nthe weather will keep getting colder until they \" have to go to hell to warm up \" ( one of the film\'s few funny lines ) . \nalong the way there is subplot after subplot , hinged sloppily together by scenes that go nowhere , feel perfunctory , and ultimately make no sense . \nfor example , our heroes are eventually attacked by a swarm of giant mechanical insects with machineguns attached to their torsos . \nnow , killer bugs don\'t really go with the weather-controlling theme of the film . \nthe purpose of the bugs , other than to annihilate our heroes , is never established . \nthey\'re never even directly connected to de wynter ( they\'re controlled by his crazy henchman , played by eddie izzard ) . \nthe special effects aren\'t bad , but they\'re loud , obnoxious , and intrusive . \nlike so many scenes in the film , it seems present only to keep your attention from waning . \nand i guarantee you , it will wane . \ni stopped thinking about the story when i realized it didn\'t do any good to think . \nthe avengers has clearly been chopped up and re-assembled so many times that even the people involved couldn\'t tell us what happens . \nthere are several scenes in the preview that didn\'t make the final cut . \nin addition , many of the sequences have irritating , grainy film quality , which makes it feel low-budget ( the last scene is particularly bad ) . \nthe scenes that don\'t feature action should be electric , thanks to our wonderful cast . \nthey aren\'t . \nthe action scenes should be electric , because this is an action film . \nthey aren\'t , either . \nand what about this wasted cast ? \noh , it makes me weep with disappointment . \nwe\'re talking ralph fiennes here , one of the best actors working today , one of the best actors * ever * . \ni love the guy . \ni\'ve loved all his films , until this one . \nhe seems like he wants to understand the film , but he\'s as lost as we are . \nand thurman , in all of her spectacular beauty and talent , can\'t manage to look at home here . \n ( i don\'t blame her completely , for there is a strange subplot involving her evil twin that is never explained in any way , and it can\'t be easy to deal with such terrible screenwriting . ) \nconnery , however , seems the most out of it , totally lacking any kind of focus , or interest , for that matter . \nwho is to blame ? \nis it the screenwriter , don macpherson ? \nperhaps , although i can see a shell of a story here that could have been a good superhero movie had it been handled right . \nis it the actors ? \nfor god\'s sake , no -- these people clearly lost interest when they saw the inevitable path of destruction on which this film was travelling . \ni blame director jeremiah chechik , who shouldn\'t have been given the task to begin with . \nhis best film , benny & joon , is quirky in the same way that this one was supposed to be , but here it mostly seems like a lot of failed attempts at wit and humor . \nadd to that a lack of experience in big-budget action , and you have the worst choice for director this side of james ivory . \nif the avengers has a saving grace , it\'s the set design . \nthe sets ( by stuart craig ) are big , colorful , and often pleasing to look at . \ni like the final set-piece , on de wynter\'s island , even if none of it makes a bit of sense . \ni admired the overhead view of the stairs , showing dr . peel running around in circles and never getting anywhere . \ni also enjoyed michael kamen\'s music score , particularly in the opening credits . \nbut this stuff is routine -- good sets and music are nice , but there\'s a lot more that needs to be here . \ninspiration , for instance , would have been really nice . \nmaybe a little bit of cohesion in the story . \nor a sense of purpose . \nmost of all , though , i would have liked to see these actors relish in their roles . \ndamn this movie for not giving them the chance . \n'~neg
'the second jackal-based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal ) , this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland , and is directed by a man who hailed from joblo\'s own alma matter , concordia university in montreal , canada . \nthe story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal , but does not pretend to be 100\% factual . \nplot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal , in order to put an end to the actual militant\'s radical activities . \nhe is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee . \nramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this \" assignment \" , and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism , intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . ) \ncritique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime . \nadmittedly , i wasn\'t a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film , and didn\'t expect much from this movie beforehand , but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments , as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line . \nthe first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come , and does offer a great characterization of the jackal , but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending . \nquinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal , but didn\'t offer anything extraordinary , in my opinion . \nsutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that they\'ve played in both of their respective careers of late , but nonetheless , appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters . \ni didn\'t like performance put forth from quinn\'s wife in this flick , but then again , she doesn\'t show up in most of the film , so that wasn\'t so bad . \ni did however enjoy director duguay\'s interesting style and cinematic vision . \nthis thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences , but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer . \ni thought that was neat . \nhaving said that , i didn\'t think the first hour needed to be as long as it was , and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the \" fake \" jackal met with the \" real \" jackal\'s girlfriend without much retrospection on her part , but all in all , not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre . \nlittle known facts : ben kingsley\'s real name is krishna banji , he stands 5 \" 8 , was born in scarborough , england , and won the best actor honor in 1982\'s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi . \nmany scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal , canada ( joblo\'s haven of restfulness ) . \ndonald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland , is canadian , and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal . \n'~pos
'if snake eyes were a dog , you\'d put it to sleep . \nif it was a couch , you\'d put it out on the sidewalk , where it would sit for a week . \nif it were your child , you\'d be reading military school catalogs . \nif it were a ship -- no , it wouldn\'t be the titanic , that would imply glamor and tragedy -- it would be the exxon valdez . \n ( personal side note : i saw this movie on the road during a houston business trip . \nfor whatever reason , my hotel\'s cable system wasn\'t showing the astros-braves game , which featured a randy johnson-greg maddux matchup . \nthis forced me to pay full price for snake eyes instead of watching a perfectly good baseball game for free -- so the invective , deserved as it is , should be seen in that perspective . ) \nsnake eyes is supposed to be a mystery movie , and good mystery movies are supposed to leave you asking yourself questions on the way out of theater . \nsnake eyes is not a good mystery movie , but i had some questions : where\'s the manager , and how do i get a re-admit pass ? \nif i fall asleep on the drive home and wreck my rent-a-car , can i sue brian de palma ? \nis it too late for the academy to revoke nicolas cage\'s oscar ? \nwill someone please ( i\'m begging you ) give gary sinise a role worthy of his talents ? \nand how , exactly does cage end up wearing the exact same shirt and tie as sinise does ? \nthe first and most glaringly wrong thing with snake eyes is the trailer . \nif you\'ve seen the trailer without seeing the movie , consider yourself fortunate . \nthe trailer is a work of sheer genius . \nit manages to convey everything worthy of the movie -- the noteworthy steadicam work , the exuberance of cage\'s performance as a thoroughly corrupt atlantic city policeman , the essential elements of the marginal plot . \nthe expert craftsman who pieced together a fairly good trailer out of snippets of a wretched movie deserves praise and a percentage of the gross . \n ( is a best trailer category at the oscars that far-fetched , after all ? ) \nbut all it does is set us up for an overwhelmingly disappointing movie . \nthe trailer sets up what should have been a promising plot : detective ricky santoro ( cage ) must solve the mystery of who shot the secretary of defense at an atlantic city pay-per-view boxing match . \nunfortunately , there are multiple problems afoot . \nthe trailer gives away much , too much of the story . \nthe shooter is killed instantly , so the story revolves around why the secretary was killed and who is involved in the conspiracy . \nthe film\'s secret is ho-hum at best , and anyone who has watched the trailer and is aware of the law of economy of characters can figure out who the top conspirator is . \nwithout an interesting plot , without interesting dialogue , and without much of a reason to care about the characters or the story , snake eyes is a failure on almost every possible level . \nas much as i hated this movie , i must give brian de palma one tiny bit of credit . \nde palma is maddeningly inconsistent . \nhe can , on his day , create amazingly well-done movies ( the untouchables , carlito\'s way ) . \non off-days , he can be , well , just horrid ( the bonfire of the vanities , raising cain ) . \nsnake eyes falls into the horrid category , but there are a couple of moments that are worth seeing strictly for their film-school degree-of-difficulty value . \nthe steadicam opening scene does a good job of introducing the cage character and is a virtuoso technical job by both the director and the actor . \nthere is a split-screen chase scene that looks pretty good , and it\'s followed by a god\'s eye view of a bank of hotel rooms that\'s imaginitively done . \nthis is what\'s called giving the devil his due . \nbut the technical skill doesn\'t even come close to making up for the sheer evil of this movie . \nplacing plot holes to one side for a moment , snake eyes features easily the worst boxing match in cinema history ( george foreman is in better shape than the movie boxers ) , a hurricane that exists for no other reason than to punctuate significant plotlines with portentuous thunderclaps , and perhaps the worst , most overly drawn out ending in years . \nsnake eyes is a criminal act , an evil waste of time and talent . \ncage , sinise , and yes , even de palma deserve better . \nthe audience deserves better -- but no refund , no re-admit pass , no free popcorn coupon , can ever restore to us the time we\'ve spent or wash the awful images from our mind . \nhowever , we are left with one consolation , that we were warned by the movie\'s title -- because snake eyes is nothing more than a roll of craps . \n'~neg
'one of the last entries in the long-running carry on series , carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a \'caravan\' site . \nprofessors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains . \nanna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance , when anna is asking for \'scrubbers for dirty caravan\' , she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan ! \narthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them . \nmother-in-law jokes prevail . \nfurthermore , the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families . \nfred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday . \nhowever , they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls , sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) . \nthe story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp , the search for the minah bid and greyhound , the major , fred and ernie\'s desperate need of a woman , a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan park\'s pub , and a shock in store for daphne . \nthe partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing . \nthis is what binds the movie together . \njoan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law , bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife , and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast . \non the other hand , there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman , and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen ! \neven though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman , there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors . \nalthough the regular cast is depleted , the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film . \na relative flop at the cinema , this movie deserves a lot more recognition . \n'~pos

\njoker ? ) and now has a body temperature of a big fat zero and has a blue body . \nbatman ( george ) and robin ( chris ) fight him a bit but find they\'re growing apart . \nmeanwhile , another villain shows up , poison ivy ( uma ! ) , who was a dorky scientist chick working on flowers in south america with a twistet scientist ( john glover ) who kills her when she finds out he\'s used her research to develop an uberman , bane , who is basically a man pumped with chemicals which probably killed any personality he ever had . \nshe emerges from her chemicals ( don\'t ask \'cause i can\'t tell ya ) as a sexy woman ( the real uma ) who\'s poison when or if you kiss her and has some aphrodiasiatic scent she blows at people . \nshe starts to tear away at the dynamic duo . \nmeanwhile , alfred\'s dying of the same disease mr . freeze\'s wife has ( but in an earlier state than she ) , and his niece , barbara ( alicia ) , comes all the way from oxford without an english accent to get him away from the butler trade , but soon ( well , not really soon , it takes her 2 hours ) becomes batgirl . \nmeanwhile , in an unfinished subplot , bruce ( batman\'s alter-ego , if you forgot ) has been dating the lovely julie madison ( the even lovlier elle macpherson ) who wants a commitment after a year but he says nothing . \nend of her for all we know . \nmr . freeze ultimately teams with poison ivy and they want to freeze the world and then take it over growing new plants as their population ( don\'t ask ! ! ! ) . \nthe trio must team together \" as family \" to beat them . \nthere ya go . \nnot the whole story but no big context clues . \ntoo much , right ? \nright ! \nthe films seems patched together of nice little ideas which would have made for a couple good sequels . \nhowever , while tim burton nicely balanced the villain/batman storyline ( although not wonderfully ) , joel seems to do almost nothing with batman in this one . \nhe gets some corny speeches , a couple clever lines and that\'s it . \nmaybe some stunts . \nfor all this , i can\'t even comment on george clooney as batman - i hardly saw the guy ! \nand when i did , he had horrible dialogue to say . \ni think michael keaton is the quintessential batman but val kilmer was too robotic and fake as batman in the last episode . \ngeorge is in between them . \nhe\'s not quintessential , he\'s not horrible , he\'s good . \nbut i\'m sure next time when they decide to renovate the series since they\'ll be critically murdered for this sorry effort , we\'ll get a good script and clooney will shine ( if he still has the job ) . \nthe villains are the only interesting part of the series according to schumacher . \nlast time , we had the brawn of two face as played by tommy lee jones and the brains/comedy supplied by the riddler as realized by jim carrey . \nthis time we have a somewhat sympathetic and somewhat hatable villain ( the same guy ) , mr . freeze . \nwe feel bad for his mental/physical collapse but does he really need to kill everyone for plants ? \narnold isn\'t very good - too hokey but kinda sympathetic at some points . \nwhen he watches old movies of his wife , he actually looks somber . \nwow . \nbut uma makes the most of her seductive character , getting the right point between hamminess and seductiveness . \nit\'s like she\'s almost parodying herself in \" pulp fiction \" at points . \nshe\'s incredibly hot and makes the movie pretty much a star better . \nas for the lower bat-people , chris is the same as he was in \" batman forever , \" although i think his work in these is too hokey when he\'s best at quieter parts in \" scent of a woman \" or just plain cool parts in \" fried green tomotoes . \" \nalicia - i love the girl but she\'s not particularly good in this film . \nshe can hypotheitically act , we all saw that in \" clueless , \" but her lines kinda sound weird . \nand it isn\'t the mushy-mouth this time . \nbut in all fairness , she has virtually no part . \njoel gets around to her occasionally and when she\'s on , she does stupid stuff . . . although \ni know i\'m not the only one who loved the catfight between her and uma . . . \nand poor elle . \npoor , poor elle . \ni love that woman and she can also hypothetically act ( for those of us who saw \" sirens \" ) . \nbut she has no part ! ! ! \nit seems like joel had so much footage that he had to edit almost an hour out of the final product . \nthere are no \" couch \" scenes ( like my best friend noticed ) . \nnow listen to me on this one - in every \" batman \" flick , there\'s a couch scene . \nin the original , it was with vicki . \nin \" returns , \" it was a good make-out scene with selena . \nand in the last one , it was a chat with nicole . \nthis one , it\'s nothing . \nand batgirl does next-to-nothing in this film till the end when she\'s suddenly \" part of the family . \" \nfortunately , we get a lot of alfred . \nhe\'s the always reliable butler , in case you didn\'t know , who has been with bruce all his life . \nhe\'s a god . \nhe\'s a father figure . \nhe\'s also dying . \nthis got to me . \ni love alfred almost as much as bruce and to see him in a robe , not in his tux , and freaking dying just gets to me . \nwe also get the idea that he might have been unhappy the whole time . . . but \nthis is never answered , as this film is too cluttered . \nbut in defense , it does have some good parts , other than uma . \nfor one , george is a good batman but unfortunately gets nothing to do . \nand there are some nice touches . \nwhen they show the asylum at one point , they show the patient\'s belongings in a room and we see the riddler\'s costume . \ni laughed . \nand during a biker scene ( involving robin and batgirl - another subplot never handled past initiation period ) , we not only see coolio but a bunch of bad-asses dressed as \" droogs \" from \" a clockwork orange . \" \ni laughed at all these . \nthe film falls apart around the five-minute mark during an enormously long action sequence which must last around 20 minutes . . . or \ndid it just feel like that ? \nthe film should serve as another in the long-line of films which demonstrate that we need more intelligent films nowadays . \npeople are fed up with stupid films . \nthat\'s why the word of mouth killed \" the lost world ! \" \nthat\'s why last year , indy films grossed more than ever . \nthat\'s why this will have a strong box-office initative from people who just want to see it , like me , but will die after a week or two when the word around the grapevine kills it . \nthat\'s why the next two big-budget aciton pics are john woo\'s \" face/off \" and barry sonnenfeld\'s \" men in black , \" both which are the first two to catch on to the wave early on . \ni like joel schumacher more as a person than an artiste . \ni like some of his films ( \" flatliners , \" \" a time to kill \" ) but a lot of them suck . \nhe\'s a really eccentric person and i loved one of his quotes about how he admits to being a mediocre director and that\'s what makes him great . \nbut his costuming for woody allen\'s \" sleeper \" was more interesting than this one ( and his costuming was cool - look for the nazi number ) . \ni love the \" batman \" series . \nthe first two rocked and i did like the last one . \nbut this one is not going to be one that i watch repeatedly like the other three . \nhopefully , this will also serve as a springboard to a better batman next time . \nand maybe they\'ll get smart and bring back catwoman . \nand michael keaton . \nbut we can only hope . \n'~neg
'the cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now : \" it mu5t be found . \" \nso what , exactly , is the fifth element ? \nafter seeing luc besson\'s ambitious , much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy , i could not help but be let down by the actual answer , which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think . \nbut what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole , a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen . \nthe biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional , dismayingly so , element ( pun intended ) of the film . \nspeaking in the vaguest possible terms , the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259 , a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth , and only the four elements--earth , wind , fire , and water--united with a fifth element can stop it . \nfiguring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady , southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman , picking up where he left off in besson\'s the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) . \nall of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion , but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest . \nwhat remains interesting and exciting , however , after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil , director of photography thierry arbogast , visual effects supervisor mark stetson , and the crew at digital domain . \nthe look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last . \nthe frenzied cityscape of new york , with its vibrant day-glo colors , tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds , and the swarm of cars , cabs , and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways , is absolutely breathtaking to behold , especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film . \nbut it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings weren\'t equally as interesting , and are they ever . \nin addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world , from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores , the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier , best known for creating madonna\'s pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour . \ngaulthier\'s outlandish creations , such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps , feel more at home in besson\'s futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film . \nwhile besson\'s bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film , it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience . \nfor all its imagination , certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre . \ni really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film , ruby rhod ( chris tucker ) , a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress , sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer , speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed . \nat first this character\'s hyper energy is funny , but the act wears out its welcome very quickly . \nnot irritating , but just as strange , is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco ) , who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno . \nthe tune , as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serra\'s innovative score , is haunting , but it is also completely jarring . \nthen there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout , which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny , to boot . \nthe story\'s weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element . \nwhile still visually and aurally spectacular , the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be . \nthe big , serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers , and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward . \nas such , at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here , that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters . \nthis suspicion was confirmed by besson himself , who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that , the filmmaker watching the film with the \" enemy \" --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made . \nstill , despite the story problems , the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmaker\'s original vision come to the screen in all its audacious , undiluted glory . \nit is a fascinating example of how of one artist\'s fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams . \n'~pos
'writers : dennis feldman and jonathan hensleigh ( based on the comic book by chuck pfarrer ) \nstarring : jamie lee curtis , william baldwin , donald sutherland , joanna pacula , sherman augustus , marshall bell , cliff curtis , julio oscar mechoso \ni suppose i\'m not extremely surprised that \" virus \" comes to us from a deciple of james cameron ( john bruno ) , and if i strain real hard , i could even say that it\'s an obvious given , particuarly looking from the standpoint of mr . cameron\'s early works . \nin fact , \" virus \" is yet another in the long line of action/horror/paranoia thrillers from the \" aliens \" vein : a group of people are dropped into a mysterious situation only to find a mortally-threatening entity is out to get them , a textbook example hailing all the way back to the early talkies , and maybe even to the first pictures , albeit redeveloped by cameron in his 1986 blockbuster that earned him esteem and bigger budgets to come in his future . \nno such thing will happen to bruno , whom i believe worked in some capacity on that quasi-landmark feature ; while bruno may have studied under cameron\'s wing for years and years , i\'m beginning to wonder at what capacity , and what exactly did he learn from him . \nin fact , \" virus \" should at least be mediocre ; the fact that bruno could have worked under a man like cameron - a director who , if anything , just knows how to make a movie - and then make a film like \" virus \" is just another detraction fairly aimed at this z-grade schlockfest of a film , albeit a z-grade schlockfest with a respectable budget . \nthe film seems to not only borrow it\'s plot from last year\'s similarly-fated \" deep rising , \" but also from a clunkish b-movie from the \'80s called \" leviathan , \" an underwater thriller starring peter weller , richard crenna , hector elizando , and daniel stern about a group of miners who stumble upon an alien lifeform that was part \" alien , \" part john carpenter\'s twisted remake of \" the thing . \" \n \" virus , \" again , has a similar , uh , selling point : a group of sailors on a boat stumble upon a russian cruiser that is dead in the water . \nthey get on . \nthey break up into pairs and investigate . \nand they find an alien lifeform on board that comes in the form of energy , has taken over all the machines on board , have meshed the machines with parts from corpses , and have deemed humankind their enemy because of a misquote in the dictionary ( ha ha ) . \nnot that any of this is for a second scary or the least bit involving ; not only does this film start off with a chintzy bond-ian opening ( the destruction of the cruiser via a satellite transmission from mir ) , destroying any of the suspense in what could happen , but it also fails to bring us any interesting chracters . \nof its motley crew , it only choses as its potentially eccentric cast of characters a lead woman skipper , a masculine potential-romantic-interest , a drunken captain , a black technician , a tatooed aborigine , a manic russian survivor , and a couple other candidates for alien food , none whom are the least bit interesting or more dimensional than a thin , plain piece of writing paper . \nand it\'s not the traditional argument for films like these , where you may in fact want them all to be eaten ( even \" aliens \" played with the karma of the arrogant soldiers , but this was more of a plus-side for the film as a whole than the opposite ) ; instead , as another cliche goes , you just don\'t give a damn . \ni almost don\'t even have to say that the acting from everyone ranges from sub-par to horrific , the former being jamie lee curtis in the lead showing off what a strong female lead she is ( and she is , just not really here ) and the latter being - and it pains me to say this as he\'s a particular favorite of mine - donald sutherland , who plays the captain so poorly and without a second of credibility that this will go down as the performance-of-which-he-should-be-ashamed . \nlike anthony hopkins for \" legends of the fall \" ( the line \" scrooooooo \'em \" has been thus embroidered upon my membrance ) . \nor peter o\'toole in \" caligula . \" \ngreat actor , horrific performance . \nit happens every now and then , and it only helps sutherland\'s career that no one , except for an elite few , even bothered to see this film . \nthough it has sat on the shelves of universal studios for about two years , waiting until it can be released and make as much money as it possibly can ( read : early january , when everyone\'s still trying to catch up on the potential oscar-nominees ) , it does show that universal shelled out a pretty penny to make this film : it\'s laden with complex machinery , boasts respectable production design , and it may even feature believable special effects . . . if , of course , i , or anyone else , could see them . \n \" virus \" mostly takes place on a large , abandoned cruiser , and mostly at night until the dawn , and mostly without the use of lights , not so much for the productivity of the alien creatures in their pursuit of their human prey , but more so because , as the hollywood cliche seems to go , \" if it\'s dark enough , then the special effects will be more believable . \" \nand if you don\'t believe me , go back and rent \" godzilla , \" and tell me if there\'s even one shot where we see godzilla either a ) in his entirety in one wide shot , or b ) n the light so that we can at least see him ( well , you don\'t really have to sit through it again ; just take my word for it ) . \nbut all of this doesn\'t matter since \" virus \" is basically just one loud , cluttered mess of a movie . \nthe action scenes are muddled and as difficult to follow as any action movie i\'ve ever seen ( my , um , favorite part was the scene where a trio of them end up somehow on the outside of the ship , during a five minute bouillabaisse of tidal waves , rain , and any other ocean-extremeties the film can cook up , then end up back in the ship when one of them is revealed to have apparently drowned - well , i must say , thanks for telling me afterwards because i sure couldn\'t figure it out when i saw it ) . \nimagine the first attack of the aliens in \" aliens , \" shot from the pov of the soldiers and then the authorities in the battle car if it was all hard to follow and done without any dramatic intensity , and that\'s basically the whole of \" virus \" : one horribly-directed action scene after the other , capping it off with a proposterous gadget that saves the day and at least a couple of the original cast members . \nand my god , it\'s a long damn sit . \nwith no interesting characters , no dramatic urgency , no tension , not one good moment of action , and no mesmerizing visuals , it\'s a wonder that it even got made . \nwe already know that big movie studios\' mentality is shallow at best , and movies like \" out of sight \" and \" saving private ryan \" give you more faith in them , but movies like \" virus \" manage to drain a little more out of the pool . \ni almost wish that instead of making this movie , john bruno had gone cinema verite and captured the meetings with universal heads when they gave this film a green light . \nthey read the script , they knew they were entrusting millions upon millions of dollars into a director who might have very well been a cameron hack ( and he is ) , and they still went ahead with the project , only to have bruno and company shit back in their face . \neven though i hold universal in contempt for making this horrible movie , i\'d say even more contempt should be aimed at mr . bruno for making a movie that could be this bad . \nin fact , shouts of \" egad , man , what were you doing when you worked for cameron anyway ? \" \nare not only justifiable , but encouraged . \n'~neg
' \" very bad things , \" is the most delightfully morbid film of the year , a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldn\'t help but be won over by the material . \nthe film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas . \nthe groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau ) , who is about to be married to the controlling , wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) . \nthe other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater ) , quiet charles ( leland orser ) , and brothers , michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) . \nafter a wild night of gambling , boozing , and drugs , a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room , but after a freak accident , to everyone\'s terror , she is killed . \nas robert puts it : \" there are two options : go to the police and go to prison , or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her . \" \nafter a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body , robert is forced to kill him as well . \n \" okay , there is only one option now . \nyou can forget about calling the police , \" he says . \nby the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer , most of them are overcome with guilt , which sets off an even more elaborate series of event , that includes much , much more murder , double-crosses , and the inevitable wedding from hell . \n \" very bad things , \" which is actor peter berg\'s feature film directing debut , is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that , \" there\'s something about mary , \" wanted to be . \nit pulls out all the stops to create something fresh , original , and hilarious , even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence , gore , and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end . \nthe screenplay , also written by berg , is , to put it mildly , very funny and courageous . \nduring the second act of the film , some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death , which was beginning to undermine the humor , but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed . \nthe dialogue is edgy and inventive , and this film proves that a movie doesn\'t necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable . \nthere\'s more fun , i think , in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts . \ncameron diaz gives her best performance to date here , and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura , who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends . \ndiaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january . \nby the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger , and reciting lines like , \" stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs , \" i couldn\'t help but crack up at how \" balls-to-the-wall \" this film had become . \njeanne tripplehorn creates another character original , as daniel stern\'s wife , who late in the picture , we discover , is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with . \nit is at this level that , \" very bad things , \" was so entertaining and surprising . \njust when you thought you could predict what was going to happen , there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky . \nthe last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top . \nalthough i enjoyed the film immensely , let me make this clear : \" very bad things , \" is not a movie for everyone . \nit is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen , it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is , and it is offensive . \nluckily , these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy , since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred , politically incorrect comedy . \nthe fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and \" safe \" wide-releases coming out lately , still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry . \n'~pos

'it is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive , so delicate , so insightful and yes , even so enjoyable . \nsomehow , the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through . \nset in the 1940\'s , the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire , ride with the devil ) . \nan orphan , twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents , he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine , little voice ) , father figure to the orphans of st . cloud , obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help . \nfiguring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage , he might as well be of use , dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics . \nsoon homer is delivering babies like a professional . \nhe refuses to perform abortions , instead wondering why the couples just didn\'t behave more responsibly . \nlarch , too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals , marvels that homer \" continues to have such high expectations of people . \" \nsuch is the result of an insulated upbringing . \nthough skilled in certain medical procedures , homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else . \nhe finally figures that in order to find his place in the world , he must go out into it . \nbefriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch , he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived . \nthus , homer begins his worldly instruction , with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron , the astronaut\'s wife ) a willing tutor . \ntobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to life\'s questions . . . \nmany of which he was unaware needed to be asked . \nhe demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing . \nmichael caine is , in a word , brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans , many of whom he helped to bring into the world . \ncalling them \" princes of maine , kings of new england \" in his ritualistic goodnight , mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine . \ndelroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose , the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins . \ndirector lasse hallstrom ( what\'s eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp ) , who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter . \nregardless of one\'s personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion , it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers . \nthe title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers . \nfiguring the rules didn\'t apply to them since they didn\'t have a hand in writing them , they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along . \ndr . larch , in his own way , acts similarly . \nthere is a danger in that line of reasoning . \ngod has also given us a set of rules . \nunlike the list posted in the cider house , god\'s rules , if followed , promise us benefits beyond our imagination . \nand yet , many continue to ignore his \" rules \" preferring to make up their own as they go through life . \n \" trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding . \" \nproverbs 3 : 5 [kjv] \njust as a builder follows a designer\'s blueprint or a conductor follows a composer\'s score , why shouldn\'t we follow the rules of life given to us by life\'s architect for our own blessing ? \n'~pos
'this is your definitive \" hollywood \" movie , extremely predictable , following the basic formula ( a horrible ending ) , overzealous writing ( meaning the writing was bad and seemed as if it were trying too hard to make it exciting , therefore making it look as if many things were merely tossed in there to fill space ) and if tommy lee jones and his lovable wise-ass character ( of which we\'ve seen before in the fugitive and quite frankly , wasn\'t used enough here ) , i\'m afraid the film would have been completely unbearable . \nin this film , ashley judd plays a women who is wrongfully convicted of killing her husband while out sailing for a weekend . \nwhile in jail she finds out that her husband really is alive and that he framed the murder on her . \nover money ( how original ) . \nwhile in jail she works out , exercises and basically does her best to get into near perfect condition . \nnow she has learned about a law titled \" double jeopardy \" stating that if she serves her full sentence and get out she could kill her husband and the law could not touch her ( although there has been talk that this is not the way the actual law works ) . \nnow her po ( parole officer ) , and a bunch of cops are chasing after her and are conflicted whether or not to believe her claims . \nskipping over to the acting : the fact that judd is more of a looker than an actress ( no offense , she has been good [simon birch] and even very good to great [kiss the girls] at times , in the past and i believe may have the potential to be better . . . \nbut she\'s terribly unconvincing in this and her performance seems stale and unsatisfying ) doesn\'t really add to the movie at all ; just takes away . \nas i\'d said , jones was fine , although he did not have much to work with . \nhe was much more of a supporting character . \nwhich is fine , and he handled it well ; especially considering the material he had to work with . \ni feel this film had alot going for it . \noriginality not being an issue . \nthe acting was the only thing ( as i said ) keeping it alive . \nthe plot seemed pretty intriguing and could have been as well if applied better . \nthe action scenes were well made ( however sometimes out of place ) . \ni was just left unsatisfied in the long run . \nso basically some of the action may have been exciting but genuinely over-thought , the plot has certainly been done before ( generally speaking ) , the movie moves way too fast for us to get involved in either the characters or the plot , and is basically a film that was almost saved by tommy lee jones , who if he had some more screentime , could perhaps have earned the film a higher rating ; in my book , anyway . \nkeep this in mind , if you\'re in the mood for a good action film -- rent the fugitive . \nd+ \n'~neg
'known as the most successful , highest-grossing romantic comedy in history , director garry marshall apparently struck gold with \" pretty woman , \" which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but , thanks to positive word-of-mouth , was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone . \nthe question of why it worked so well lies directly with the film\'s two charismatic stars , richard gere and julia roberts , since the story itself is none too original or even believable . \nthe other winning element that makes \" pretty woman \" so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence , which is rarely as palpable in today\'s films as it is here . \nedward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave , extremely wealthy business mogul who , at the start of the picture , breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument , and abruptly takes his friend\'s car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel . \nstopping the car along the street , he asks a woman , obviously a prostitute , for directions . \nagreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks , edward ultimately accepts , they strike up a conversation , and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor . \nthis meeting does not lead to sex , however , as edward confides that he\'d rather just have someone to talk to , and offers her $300 to spend the night . \njust as well , since the hooker , named vivian , is a beautiful , generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear . \nthe meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned , when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area , keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers . \nsince vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips , which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers , the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act , edward and vivian will finally , truly , kiss . \nallegedly planned as a grim , downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director , \" pretty woman \" has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale , a la \" cinderella . \" \nthe premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been . \nyou honestly don\'t need a high-iq ( or any iq , for that matter ) to guess how the film will end , and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha . \nthe supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying , and the screenplay is no award winner . \nand yet , amidst all of these qualms and flaws , \" pretty woman \" is an astoundingly charming motion picture , and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers . \nyou\'d actually be amazed how far bemusement can go , and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes , mind you ) that are as romantic as anything i\'ve seen on film in the 1990\'s . \nadditionally , the film belongs , and its success can be attributed , to two people and two people only , and they are richard gere and julia roberts . \nplaying sex symbols throughout the \'80s with such pictures as \" american gigolo \" and \" an officer and a gentleman , \" gere branches out here to play a more quiet , almost shy , but still alluring , character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet , and vice versa . \njulia roberts , in her breakthrough role after 1988\'s well-received \" mistic pizza \" and 1989\'s \" steel magnolia , \" for which she was nominated for an academy award , is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian , who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers , not for her line of work , but more for her sheer intelligence . \nit would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake , but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing . \nafter \" pretty woman , \" roberts , along with meg ryan , became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released \" runaway bride , \" which repairs gere and roberts together once again ) , and no wonder . \nroberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy , but also one who can efficiently do drama , and in almost every film she appears in , it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star . \nan especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute , and he then approaches her , making sexual advances . \nno only does this make vivian feel cheap , especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional , eloquent young lady , but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way , and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading , and if she likes this particular path . \non the more dreamy side , the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold , especially one in which edward enters into the hotel\'s lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress , but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty . \nanother subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward , who is asleep , and placing it on his lips , since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days . \n \" pretty woman \" does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene , which is a happy ending ( as you\'d expect , and wouldn\'t have it any other way ) that somehow does not work , perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances . \nthis one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film , though , because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem . \nhelped along by a warm , memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo , as vivian\'s best friend and roommate , and a fabulously catchy soundtrack , in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movie\'s overall fulfillment , \" pretty woman \" is a sparkler of a motion picture , and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy . \n'~pos
'dead-bang , an action thriller starring don johnson , lives up to its dumb title , or at least to half of it . \nalthough dead-bang is definitely dead , it is anything but a bang ; in fact , they should have called this one \" dead bore . \" \nin the film , johnson plays . . . \nyou guessed it . . . \na cop . \nthe role must have been really challenging for johnson since his character , jerry beck , is a gritty los angeles homicide detective , a real stretch from the slick vice detective johnson portrayed on \" miami vice . \" \na la mel gibson in lethal weapon , beck is an emotional wreck , complete with violent outbursts , unscrupulous police methods , and a bleak outlook on life . \nbeck\'s wife has just divorced him , and she is cutting him off from their children . \nshe will not even allow him to wish them \" merry christmas \" by telephone . \nbut beck\'s family and emotional problems take a back seat to the action and thrills in dead-bang . \nbeck is investigating the brutal murders of a shopkeeper and a cop . \nhis investigation starts in l . a . and finally culminates and climaxes in oklahoma , where he has a violent showdown with the killers at a white supremacist camp . \nvirtually every aspect of dead-bang is inept and ineffective . \nthe plot is incoherent and full of holes . \nthe movie depicts beck\'s investigation so clumsily that you never see the connections between his clues and his conclusions . \nthe action sequences in dead-bang are strictly third-rate , and the movie has absolutely no momentum or suspense . \ni certainly expected more from long-time director john frankenheimer who directed the classic political thriller , the manchurian candidate--as well as black sunday , seven days in may , and the french connection ii . \nin all fairness to frankenheimer , however , i should note that most of dead-bang\'s shortcomings seem to stem from its shabby script rather than from the direction . \ndead-bang tries to don a mask of social relevance by incorporating themes of racism and white supremacy , but its efforts are nothing more than token gestures and nothing less than insulting . \naccording to the movie\'s production notes , dead-bang is based on the real-life experiences of still-active detective jerry beck . \nyou would never guess this from watching dead-bang , however , since the film totally lacks credibility ; it is utterly unconvincing and unbelievable . \nmost of the characters in dead-bang are either atrociously acted , underdeveloped , superfluous , or all of the above . \nwilliam forsythe , for example , is painfully bad as arthur kressler , a wholesome by-the-book fbi agent who\'s offended by beck\'s foul language and unorthodox methods . \nforsythe\'s lame performance and corny dialogue makes his character unbearable . \ndead-bang marks the motion picture debut of tim reid ( \" wkrp in cincinnati \" and \" frank\'s place \" ) , but his talents are completely wasted in a cliched and contrived role ; he plays the chief officer of a squadron of black cops who help beck to nail the villains . \nthe sole function of penelope ann miller\'s character is to give dead-bang an excuse to include a gratuitous love scene between characters about whom you could not care less . \ni guess the film\'s title refers to this love scene since it\'s definitely a dead bang . \nthe only real virtue of dead-bang , believe it or not , is don johnson , who tries to overcome the limitations of the movie\'s pitiful script . \njohnson succeeds in giving his character a sarcastic sense of humor and a hint of depth , and his pessimistic wisecracks occasionally bring the film to life . \nand i must admit that dead-bang does have one or two amusing moments . \nthe funniest scene has johnson throwing-up all over a criminal as he interrogates him . \nbut when barf is the highlight of a movie , you know the movie\'s in trouble . \nthe other amusing scene involves a psychological examination of beck , in which he can\'t keep a straight face because the psychiatrist resembles woody allen . \nbut two funny scenes and a couple good wisecracks do not a movie make . \n'~neg

'it was once said that in order to truly enjoy some of todays movies or novels , you must suspend disbelief .  \nhowever , there is a distinct separation between opening your mind to ridiculous situations and believing a bunch of flat lies . \nit came as no surprise to me to learn that huntingburg , indiana ( where the film is set ) , does not have a mcdonald\'s , a sears store , a statue of a man on a horse , nor even a dam close by . \neven if you can ignore these somewhat white lies ( even though the dam is crucial to hard rains plot ) ; there is still a bunch of things that just dont gel . \nfirstly , morgan freeman , possibly the greatest actor alive ( after such films as driving miss daisy , the shawshank redemption and se7en ) , was cast as a shifty goon intent on stealing enough money for a healthy retirement . \nhe _should_ have played the town sheriff , an experienced and somewhat intriguing policeman . \nas a massive flood started by a dam accident overwhelms huntingburg , its residents presumably flee as the water level steadily increases . \ni say presumably simply because we never know what happened to them ; and it seems a tad strange that an entire town ( with the exception of some folk who get introduced along the way ) can vanish before the flood has actually started . \nbut nether the less , armored guard couriers tom ( christian slater ) and his uncle are carrying three million dollars in the back of their van . \nwith a heavy rainstorm causing depressing conditions and slippery roads , it doesnt take long for the van to end up stuck amongst mud and water off the side of the road . \njim ( morgan freeman ) and a small gang of thieves locate the van and attempt to steal the three million dollars . \nbut of course tom is more than willing to save the day , so he takes the money and hides it elsewhere in town . \nthe local sheriff ( randy quaid , whom most will remember as the drunken pilot in id4 ) and a couple of police men investigate the situation , but their morals are soon overpowered by greediness as each character contemplates what he/she would do with their share of the three million dollars . \ndirector mikael salomon has made sure that hard rain ends up turning everything topsy-turvy , and whilst the film may at first appear to be a definite goodies versus baddies ,  there are numerous twists in its plot that make this a slightly more enjoyable experience . \nbut by the time these interesting changes occur , its far too late in the film for them to have much affect . \nhard rains continuos corniness and lack of originality washes out whatever hope the script may have had ; and although its cast is somewhat appealing most of its stars act well below par . \nnot at one stage capturing what could have been a fabulous on screen battle between slater and freeman , we are left to reminisce on films that dared to do something different and achieved more than what was expected . \nsuch titles as broken arrow ( slater and john travolta ) and face/off ( nicholas cage and john travolta ) come to mind as films that have mastered silver screen confrontations . \nstrangely enough , they were both directed by john woo and both star john travolta . \nwe can forgive morgan freeman for giving a slightly disappointing performance since he is newish to the action genre , but christian slater could have achieved so much more had the amount of crummy one liners been reduced and some personality added to his character . \nif you had asked me whether slater could perform well enough to substantially boost a movie prior to the release of broken arrow , my answer would have been a definite no . \ni now know that he has no excuse , and _can_ do better ( if you dont believe me rent a copy of broken arrow from your local video store ) . \nalthough hard rain never really works from the start , i somehow felt feelings of missed opportunity when the credits filled the screen . \nthe addition of an enticing sub-plot would have given the film time to breathe , rather than try to cram 96 minutes of action and disaster into a story that cant handle anything else . \ndespite the fact that hard rain fails on almost every account , if your standards are low enough you may find this to be a mildly enjoyable film . \nno creative flair and no inventive scenes means that hard rain does not stand up well against its many competitors , but it doesnt really matter since the last thing you would want to do after shelling about $8 . 50 is compare this to other films . \n'~neg
'this remake of \" la cage aux folles \" features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their son\'s future in-laws . \nthe couple ( robin williams and nathan lane ) are about as archetypal , or as the less kind might put it ? stereotypical , gays possible . \nwilliams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star . \nthey live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode . \nwilliams is excellent as should be no surprise . \ngene hackman as right-wing potential father-in-law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles . \nthe real star is lane . \nhis attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight-shooting uncle is hilarious . \nperhaps it is a personal failing on my part , but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it . \nluckily ( for me at least ) , it doesn\'t last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men , their son and the deception . \nthe question of stereotypes is a touchy one . \nthese guys personify the homophobic gay image . \nyou can almost hear the swishing . \nif you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world , you\'ll be outraged . \nbut if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals , you\'ll love it . \nyour choice . \n'~pos
' \" some houses are born bad , \" goes the haunting\'s tag line , to which i must add , \" some movies , too . \" \nnothing short of hiring a new cast , a more literate screenwriter , and a new director could have saved this tragically misguided adaptation of jackson\'s meritorious novel . \nthe haunting is late entry summer dreck too slick to be creepy , and its seemingly endless stream of digital trickery and spooky ooky sound effects don\'t frighten so much as numb the audience into submission-the film is like a rube goldberg contraption rigged to shout \" boo . \" \nfragile nell ( taylor ) , bisexual theo ( zeta-jones ) , and smiley luke ( wilson ) are three insomniacs who gather at the reputedly possessed hill house for an extended study on sleep disorders , hosted by professor marrow ( neeson ) . \nmarrow\'s secretly gathering data on their respective paranoid responses to his recount of hill house\'s bleak history . \nhe\'s not prepared for the very real apparitions that terrorize the crew , nell especially , who has some ancestral connection to the manor\'s previous inhabitants . \ntaylor is thoroughly insufferable in her first big-budget lead . \nfor starters , her consistently dour expression sucks the life out of even the early scenes , when we\'re introduced to the mansion and all its fun-house trappings . \nher character is supposed to be depressed , having tended to an unloving mother for too many years , but taylor plays nell as supernaturally lame , alternately grouchy , mopey , wiggy and pathetic , and i kept wondering why the other characters didn\'t just ditch this bitch . \nas for the obscenely photogenic zeta-jones , she breezes through her scenes with a wink and a smile and takes the scenery with her . \nunfortunately , she\'s saddled with some of the most unlikely dialogue the screenplay has to offer . \ntheo\'s assessment of the house ? \n \" i love it ! \nsort of charles foster kane meets the munsters . \" \nwho on earth would say that in place of \" citizen kane meets the munsters \" ? \n ( furthermore , would you gladly spend a single night in a house befitting that description ? ) \nboth actresses fare better than neeson , who looks embarrassed to be a part of this ensemble ( and for good reason ) , and his character is the most bland . \nas luke puts it , dr . marrow pulls the old \" academic bait and switch \" on his subjects , but he breaks down and confesses to this the second he\'s accused . \nlater , he risks his life by climbing a crumbling stairwell to save nell ( it\'s amusing to hear neeson shout \" nell \" repeatedly , given his starring role in the 1994 jodie foster vehicle of the same name ) . \nwhy was this nice , helpful , and redemptive researcher so absent of ethics at the start ? \nthe haunting was well designed by eugenio zanetti . \nhis sets are obsessively detailed , and even before the cgi kicks in , they seem alive , never quite still . \ni do have one beef with this aspect of the production : the real life mansion used in exterior shots , nottinghamshire\'s harlaxton manor , is so vast that one has trouble believing that nell and company , no matter how much running away they do from ghosts and goblins , always finish up in locations that were established in act one , as if all the action has been confined to one wing of hill house . \neighty million dollars was spent on the haunting , and despite a powerhouse box office debut , i doubt it will recoup its costs ( including marketing ) domestically . \nthank jan de bont for that : proving for the third time that speed was a fluke , in that it was actually enjoyable , de bont has served up another ride , sans thrill . \nhis images , well-lit though they are , have an unmistakable been there-done that quality ; in fact , whole sequences , not to mention the cloaked , airy ghoul who owns the climax , feel lifted from a much smarter and infinitely more enjoyable spectacle from three summers back , peter jackson\'s the frighteners . \ni don\'t mean to suggest de bont is a plagiarist , i mean to suggest that he\'s a hack , having found no new ways to give us chills . \n'~neg
'seen may 19 , 1999 at 5 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland , n . y . ) , theater #1 , with my brother john for $8 . 50 . \n[theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats , sound and picture] \n ( critic\'s note : this review is the longest i\'ve ever written and still only scratches the surface . \ni\'d recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . ) \nas my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace\' - how do i even write this review ? \nnever mind the fact that i\'ve been waiting for a new `star wars\' movie since i was seven years old . \nnever mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released . \nnever mind that there\'s so much going on in this movie in terms of plot , action , special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldn\'t cover everything . \nand also like ted does in all of his reviews , i\'ll try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you , the reader . \nbefore we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film , many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film , skip this and the next four paragraphs ) . \nas has been made obvious for the last several years , another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars\' series ( the first of the films was actually episode four , not one ) . \ngeorge lucas , the creator of the series , has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars , \' `the empire strikes back\' and `return of the jedi\' ) is actually the second trilogy , chronologically . \nin media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order , but i can\'t recall his reasons . \nwith this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . . \nsecond trilogy . . . \nwell you know what i mean ) . \nand in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which , unfortunately , may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution . \n[critic\'s note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed , but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule . \ncritic\'s note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics\' law of reviewing movies , which as roger ebert coined , `it\'s not what a movie is about , but how it is about it . \' \nbecause so many outside factors come into play in the film\'s plot and significance as part of a trilogy , and just considering modern society , it again would be difficult , if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ] \nfirst of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it . \nwe know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker , who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire . \nwe know obi-wan `ben\' kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force\' in attempts to become a jedi knight , but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side . \' \nwe also know something about `the force\' itself , that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) . \nwhat we don\'t know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy , which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth . \nto me , this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle , definite order to all the complexity . \nalso , it seems that we\'re supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended . \nmost notably , details regarding the emperor from `empire\' and `jedi , \' and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine . \nfor those who haven\'t kept up with all the `star wars\' paraphernalia over the years , there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) . \nwith `the phantom menace\' being the first chapter of a long saga , one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid , including the history behind all the major factors of the series , especially `the force\' and the jedi knights . \nunfortunately , this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained . \ni didn\'t liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness . \nif you\'re going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) . \nbut i digress . \ni\'ve said so much and yet i haven\'t even touched on the specifics of the film itself . \nall these necessary `disclaiming\' elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars\' series is and this individual film itself . \nwhat we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three we\'ve come to know and love since the late 1970s . \nits similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar , but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality . \nthe basic story is rather sorted , complex and even confusing at times . \nwe\'re told that an army known as `the trade federation\' has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo . \nwe\'re not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is , instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly . \nwe\'re introduced to two jedi , the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) . \nthe two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planet\'s queen , amidala ( portman ) . \nthe leader of the federation , an alien called viceroy , is following the orders of a strange , mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears . \nhe is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance , and especially that creepy evil voice of his , he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series . \nsidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person . \nclearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film , but should be clear to most viewers . \ni have a feeling we\'ll delve into his background in the next two films ) . \nbut it doesn\'t take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the film\'s story begins to move along . \nthe film doesn\'t have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another . \nthere are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook . \nthe other films have relied on this type of storytelling , but because of the limits of the technology at the time , the films\' screenplays were also limiting . \nthe sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace\' its unique traits . \nas we already know , the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars\' trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story . \nand here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd ) , by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council . \nto briefly summarize the story , jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidala\'s spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation . \ntheir meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force . \njinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force , and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter , more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves . \nthis also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before . \nin fact , it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before . \nthe element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary . \nby the film\'s third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot . \nit\'s funny how the reality of the `star wars\' world seems so embedded in mythology , new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence . \nnot that this technique hasn\'t been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history . \nand at least it\'s all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter . \nit does border of the cartoonish sometimes , but that\'s just the film appealing to our inner child , which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society . \n`the phantom menace\' delivers exactly what you\'d expect from a `star wars\' film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness . \nso many things in the film we\'ve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited . \nbut this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies . \n'~pos
'play it to the bone is a punch-drunk mess of a movie . \ncontaining a good cast but awful acting ; an interesting premise but terrible execution , ron shelton ( white men can\'t jump ) gives us a rocky story with not one rocky but two . \nrocky no . 1 is vince boudreau ( woody harrelson , edtv ) , a bald , tattooed , newly converted christian , whose idea of christianity is not using the name of christ as a curse word . . . \nsomething that he has not yet successfully achieved . \nrocky no . 2 is caesar dominguez ( antonio banderas , the 13th warrior ) , best friend of vince who is currently dating vince\'s ex-girlfriend , grace . \nboth men are nearing the end of their \" almost \" careers when a fluke provides them with a redemptive opportunity . \nwhen both fighters of the undercard of a vegas based mike tyson title fight become incapacitated , the fight promoters need to find a quick replacement . \nour boys are tapped to fight each other , the winner of which is \" promised \" a shot at a future title fight . \nthe film is divided into two sections . \nat first , we have a buddy road picture as our two heroes , in grace\'s \" sassy grassy \" green muscle car , travel through the desert to vegas in order to make the fight scheduled for that day . \nalong the way we learn about their pasts and the opportunities that have come and gone by . \nonce in vegas , the movie settles down to the effectively staged fight sequences between vince and caesar . \nboth mr . harrelson and mr . banderas have provided us with stunning characterizations in the past , not that we\'d know it from their work here . \nmr . harrelson is uncomfortably awkward , apparently never having gotten a firm handle on vince . \nthe christian conversion angle simply falls flat and unbelievable . \nmr . banderas is uncharacteristically non-charismatic as caesar . \nweak and ineffectual , there is little life in his screen performance . \nthe other actors involved merely play stereotypes of one sort or another . \ntom sizemore ( saving private ryan ) , robert wagner ( austin powers ii : the spy who shagged me ) , and richard masur ( fire down below ) are crooked promoters , lucy liu ( payback ) is a sex-starved hitchhiker looking for a good time , and lolita davidovich ( gods and monsters ) , is the shared girlfriend who can\'t make her mind up which boxer she prefers . \nbecause of the weak characters and the lack of screen chemistry between them , the film flounders with all the appeal of a dead fish until the boxing match actually begins . \nbut even then , because the outcome is so predictably obvious , the suspense factor is negated and we are relegated to just watching two men pummel each other . \nwriter/director ron shelton clearly spent much time orchestrating the fight sequence as it is well photographed , well-choreographed , well-edited , and well-performed . \nif only some of that same detailed attention had been diverted to the remaining parts of the film . \nas it is , the scenes which require the characters to actually talk to one another are weak and laughable . \nthe title is actually the most interesting aspect of the film . \nthe phrase , \" play it to the bone\' is a reference to seeing something all the way through or not quitting until you\'ve achieved your desired goal . \nthat is a biblical principle . \n \" know ye not that they which run in a race run all , but one receiveth the prize ? \nso run , that ye may obtain . \" \n1 corinthians 9 : 24 [kjv] \nachieving anything worthy in life requires \" playing it to the bone \" . \nwe need to develop fully persuaded mindsets and commitment levels in order to endure and persevere past the obstacles and distractions which lay between us and our stated objectives . \nthis is true in practical matters of our physical lives as well as the in the developing maturity of our spiritual lives . \nas a movie , play it to the bone is hardly worth our time . \nbut as a principle of life , the phrase \" play it to the bone \" are words to live by . \n'~neg
'the story of us , a rob reiner film , is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film , as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films . \nwell , 1999 has two of them , the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family , american beauty . \nthe story of us , a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family , is a well written , heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience , including myself , cry . \nthe story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan , and asks the question , \" can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ? \" \nthe film is about two individuals who have come together , spent a good chunk of their lives together , and shows when our main characters are \" him \" and \" her \" ( during the bad times ) , and when they are \" us \" ( during the good times ) . \nthe story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day . \nben and katie now only see and live with each other because they don\'t want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer , or at least say they don\'t , love each other anymore . \nben , a cartoonist , and katie , a crossword puzzle writer , have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage , as they have grown to follow different views on life , family , and marriage . \nkatie is the more organized , sophisticated type , who wants to plan everything out , while ben is a spontaneous , adventurous individual who doesn\'t mind doing things differently than they were planned . \nthe story of us plays out nicely , as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist , told to the viewer through flashbacks . \nas the film progresses , it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist , with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage . \nthis method is highly effective , as we see the characters changing from year to year , slowly growing apart . \nthrough the flashbacks , we get to see the story of them through both of the character\'s eyes , and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like , as the story of us has three dimensional , believable main characters . \nthe screenplay , written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet ) , is a touching , down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer , much like another one of nelson\'s films , stepmom . \nthe script has an open honesty and outlook on life , one that is so realistic , you feel uncomfortable at many times , because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar , as most families these days most go through the hard times , as ben and katie must . \nif it wasn\'t for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote , which are rugged and certainly flawed , the story of us would have been this year\'s best picture . \nbruce willis , a usual action/adventure star , has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies , to a distinguished , sophisticated actor , as in last summer\'s the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us , willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script . \nalthough i wouldn\'t pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan , willis handles himself nicely , and shines in a few of the film\'s most powerful scenes , enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season . \nwhere to start about michelle pfeiffer ?

'i have no real tangible proof of this , but i swear that there are a lot of producers in hollywood who adamantly believe that if you take a bad script , written by a bad writer and give the project it to an equally bad director , then it is actually possible to make a good movie . \nusing their logic , all that really needs be done to change the bad movie into a good movie is cast a bunch of super-famous actors and provide an almost unlimited production budget . \nthis is the only way i can fathom how 20th century fox hired jon amiel in order to direct this eighty million dollar waste of my time ( not counting the time it took me to get to and from the theatre ) . \nnow , before i continue to ferociously attack what\'s wrong with this film , i just want to point out that one of the reasons it fails so miserably is because it does have the potential to be an exciting thriller . \ncatherine zeta-jones plays virginia baker , an insurance investigator tracking down an infamous art thief named robert macdougal ( sean connery ) . \nif you\'ve ever seen any hollywood blockbuster before , i really don\'t have to spend too much time on frivolous plot details : the two team up for various jobs , stealing various things for various purposes . \nthe problem we come to is that we\'ve all seen this a few billion times before and this film doesn\'t break any new ground in the big-budget/hollywood/action genre . \nthe result is that the entire production feels contrived . \ni\'m going to be completely honest here : pretty much the only thing keeping me awake throughout the run-time was looking at catherine zeta-jones . \nnow while this may be a compliment for ms . zeta-jones , it certainly isn\'t for either the writers or the director , who are not nearly as clever as they think they are . \njust about the most profound thought they can inject into this film is when they have macdougal lecture baker on the semantic difference between \" entrapment \" and \" blackmail \" . \nwith an eighty million dollar budget , you\'d think that entrapment would at least feature edge-of-your seat action scenes or breathtaking special f/x . \nwell , you\'d be wrong . \nthe action that is present in this film takes place in a huge skyscraper and is relatively unspectacular . \nunfortunately for all those involved with entrapment , die hard narrowly beat it to the screen by ? 11 years . \nthe reality is that after 15 minutes of watching this picture , you know exactly what\'s going to happen , despite rather pathetic attempts in the screenplay to throw in plot twists . \nmany scenes seem to exist merely as a reason to outfit zeta-jones in extremely tight-fitting clothing . \none particular scene features baker crawling around trying to avoid laser-beams while she tries to steal an ancient chinese mask . \nnothing wrong with that , but she entered the room from the floor and knew exactly where the mask was - so why didn\'t she and macdougal tunnel in directly under the mask instead of the other side of the room ? \ni\'ll tell you why : because it\'s a great excuse to photograph zeta-jones\' posterior as it slides underneath those beams ( and it also allows a second scene of the exact same thing - the rehearsal ) . \nving rhames also makes an appearance in this movie , and though he has great screen presence ( although so do connery and zeta-jones ) and the most interesting character in the film , not even he can rescue this film from the depths of the boring film abyss ( a concept i invented just to describe this picture ) . \none last complaint : entrapment is littered of instances where macdougal will just slip into a shadow or behind a building , or he becomes obstructed by a moving vehicle and then in the next shot , he\'ll spontaneously disappear in ninja-like fashion . \ni can picture amiel patting himself on the back , thinking to himself \" it\'ll leave the audience wondering for days : how did he do that ? \" \nwe know jon , it\'s called editing . \n'~neg
'warren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest , craziest and hard hitting movie in his career . \nbased on a story concocted by himself , and also written by beatty , bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system . \nbeatty stars as senator jay bulworth , who\'s going through a nervous breakdown . \nafter hiring someone to kill him , he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about what\'s _really_ happening in american politics , much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . ) \ninstead of everyone hating him , the american public love him . \nhowever , inside his party , more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin . \nand he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . ) \nit\'s remarkable that this film was released at all . \nmuch more open than the rather subdued primary colours , bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name . \nthe outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny , and also somewhat true . \nit\'s great that beatty isn\'t afraid to let loose on a subject . \ntalking of beatty , he\'s excellent in the role of the demented senator , clearing having fun . \nand seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed . \neven in dick tracy , he was the most straighten face actor . \n ( then again , he was the only characters face we could completely see . ) \nthe film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping , which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . ) \nand seeing beatty as a \'homeboy\' has to be seen to be believed . \nit\'s nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself . \nsecond best is oliver platt as the flustered , coke snorting assistant , who goes over the top when he finally snaps . \nhalle berry is fine , and sexy , as the intellectual nina , who comes to like the senator . \nalso popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent , laurie metcalf as the exact same characters she\'s also played , and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife , who all contribute to the fun . \nand , this being a political film , the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance , as , * shock * , himself . \nthe writing and directing , both by beatty , are above par . \nthe direction is very nearly sitcom like , but suits the film perfectly , and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well . \nthe script is funny , and the raps are actually well produced and humorous , and quite clever . \nthey\'re not cringe inducing , at least . \nthe script makes many points about society in america today , and isn\'t afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system . \nbest of all , the film is thought provoking , but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather , and is very entertaining . \nthere\'s also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes . \nbulworth is a film with many advantages , and few flaws . \nperhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping , but beatty does it so well it\'s irrelevant . \nin fact , there\'s very little against bulworth , except for the language which is very heavy , but then again it should be expected . \nbulworth , then , is well worth watching . \na david wilcock review ? 1999 \n \" you know , for kids \" - norville barnes \n'~pos

'the long and illustrious career of robin williams , which has included both forgettable turns like mrs . \ndoubtfire and flubber , was punctuated with the actor\'s first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting . \nit was his first truly dramatic role since 1989\'s dead poets society , and critical remarks were unanimously positive . \nhis next role , that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come , was unfortunately lackluster . \nand so , after a six-year stint as a comedic actor , the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams . \nwilliams is the title character , hunter \" patch \" adams , sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting . \nwe\'re introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies . \nit\'s at the institution , however , that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people . \nhe removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginia\'s medical college , where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating , impersonal trade . \nhis attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion , and the movie climaxes with patch\'s appearance before the state medical board . \nthe characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense . \nalthough the script does not perform well as a narrative -- there\'s little story to be told outside of patch\'s skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters . \nat medical school , patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london ) , an outsider like himself who relishes patch\'s zest for humanity . \nthe two instantly become the best of friends , and it\'s easy to see why . \nmonica potter plays patch\'s love interest , a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school . \nfor some reason he\'s attracted to her , and although it never gets said , the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view . \nthe script -- based on hunter adams\' own story -- works well this way . \nthe rest of the cast , bob gunton as the villain professor in particular , is solid . \ndirector tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patch\'s life in a sound , intentional manner ; combined with williams\' presence on screen , the movie rarely becomes boring . \npatch adams\' lack of purpose is its major shortcoming , and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours , there\'s little feeling of continuity or the passage of time . \nnevertheless , it\'s an emotionally moving picture , and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season . \nit succeeds at everything it tries , and only fails at the stuff it doesn\'t try in the first place . \nby and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams , but more importantly , it\'s entertainment for the entire family . \n'~pos

'in recent years , harrison ford has been such a grave screen presence , scowling through the likes of tom clancy\'s jack ryan series , _the_fugitive_ , and last year\'s smash _air_force_one_ , that one wonders if the rogue charm that made him such a superstar had been completely drained from his system . \napparently , it was just lying dormant . \nwith ivan reitman\'s enjoyable romantic comedy/adventure _six_days , _seven_nights_ , the lovable scoundrel is back , giving audiences a fresh reminder of why ford is one of the most enduring and popular modern screen icons . \nford plays quinn harris , a carefree and slightly slobby ( endearingly so ) pilot in the tropics whose broken-down plane crashes in a storm , stranding him and his charter , new york magazine editor robin monroe ( anne heche ) , on a deserted island . \nof course , the sophisticated robin and the salt-of-the-earth quinn are at odds long before the plane goes down , and all manner of hostile repartee is exchanged between the two from their first meeting . \nwhile some of the lines fall flat , the formulaic motions work because of the unexpectedly electric chemistry between ford and heche . \nboth actors , who have largely done serious works as of late , seem liberated by the lack of dramatic weight on their shoulders , and they deliver their zingers , as weak as they sometimes are , with beguiling abandon . \nnaturally , there\'s nothing like a life-threatening crisis to bring two people together , and quinn and robin\'s warmup to each other is sped up even further by the arrival of some bloodthirsty pirates . \ngranted , some conflict needed to be introduced on the island , but this tacked-on development from writer michael browning is a bit too obviously thrown in for the purpose of adding gratuitous action scenes . \nbut the point is to get the two together , and their newfound affection causes complications for both , but mostly robin , who came to the islands on a vacation with her fiance frank ( david schwimmer ) , who frantically awaits her return on the home island . \nreitman , and old , reliable hand at breezy comedies , keeps the pace brisk and capably handles the more action-oriented sequences . \nhis big accomplishment , however , is bringing the old , smiling ford back . \nas appealing and charismatic as he always is , ford hasn\'t been quite this charming and affable in years ; he\'s obviously having a blast , and the audience cannot help but have one along with him . \nholding her own is heche , whose scrappy character never becomes the screaming ninny she initially promises to be ( as the plane goes down , she frantically pops stress pills ) . \nshe can take her lumps , physical and otherwise , just as well as quinn , making her a formidable foil and ideal match . \nformulaic and light as a feather , _six_days , _seven_nights_ could be cited as a classic example of the summer \" popcorn \" movie season\'s lack of substance . \nit\'s certainly fluff , but it\'s unpretentious , undemanding , and--most importantly--fun fluff that goes down as easily as a frothy pina colada on a balmy tropical beach . \npass the popcorn . \n'~pos

'near the end of 1996 , analysts remarked that the year would be the last in which disney would stand alone as the animation king . \nthe following year , 1997 , saw the first sleeper entry into the genre from a studio other than the magic kingdom : twentieth century fox gave baronial russia to the masses in the form of anastasia . \nat best , that\'s all it was -- a sleeper hit , designed to surprise but not shake the industry . \nin 1998 , however , things have been decidedly different . \nthere have been a number of pushes on disney\'s death grip on the market , and fifty-one weeks into \'98 , a new champion has emerged . \ndreamworks\' the prince of egypt succeeds where all of the other conventionally animated products have failed . \nthe other two contenders , warner brothers\' quest for camelot and disney\'s own annual entry , mulan , lacked inspiration and drive respectively . \nalthough camelot was borderline-abysmal , and can\'t really be considered a shot at the title , mulan had the makings of winner . \nunfortunately , it was saturated with traditional , disney-cute animation , and lost points against the rapidly-changing face of the competition . \nin making the prince of egypt , dreamworks has strayed from all of these hallmarks and created a genuinely unique product . \nthe animation is flawless , and , aside from a bug\'s life , is the best-looking movie to date . \nthe animators have nimbly mixed both flat and spatial effects , and the 2d/3d combination is something that artists from disney and fox have heretofore struggled with . \nthe key to success , however , was that the visuals were used not just because they looked cool but also as a method of advancing the plot . \nnamely , some of the most important action sequences ( like the parting of the red sea ) were done almost entirely in 3d . \ndreamworks is the first studio to prove that they\'ve got the stuff of success , and that they\'re capable of challenging disney . \nthe story is also well-written , and the characters voiced with talent . \nfor the most part , the plot follows its source material -- the book of exodus -- although only in the most general sense . \nthe writers took a few creative liberties , and most do not damage the story in any way . \nin fact , the shakespearean relationship between moses ( val kilmer ) and the pharaoh rameses ( ralph fiennes ) makes the story more interesting if anything . \nmoses , a hebrew , is saved from the slaughter of the firstborn sons by his mother when she sets him in a basket on the nile ; he floats into the pharaoh seti ( patrick stewart ) \'s palace and is taken in by the royal family . \nmoses grows up but learns of his heritage and flees into the desert , where he discovers the burning bush and is commissioned by god to return to egypt and free the slaves . \nby this time , rameses is now pharaoh , and the two brothers , now on opposite sides of the line , face off in a battle of wills and divine intervention . \nthe cast of voices is most impressive , and also includes such noteables as sandra bullock , jeff goldblum , danny glover , and steve martin . \nthe script does not have a lot of one-liners in it , and god is reduced to a voice that might well be mistaken for the same one that spoke to kevin costner in field of dreams , but overall the story is exciting and interesting . \nit\'s decidedly for an older crowd , and the tykes who haven\'t had a few years of religion class will be hopelessly lost . \nbut for those who make the bid , the prince of egypt can be a great watch . \n'~pos

'jack nicholson has a funny way of playing characters with very few redeeming qualities , but whom you end up liking anyway . \nin as good as it gets , the character in question is melvin udall , a successful novelist with obsessive-compulsive disorder who seems bent on having as little contact with people around him as possible , except when he feels like being a royal pain in the you-know-where . \nhe\'s mean . \ni mean really mean . \nthe opening scene shows him shoving a little dog down the trash chute of his manhattan condominium . \nevery day , melvin eats at the same cafe , sits at the same table , and gets served by the same waitress . \nyou can tell that this is his favorite place to be a vicious nuisance , when his waitress carol ( helen hunt ) tells him he can just go sit in another section , and all the other waitresses just cringe . \none day , melvin makes a comment that goes to far , and carol , genuinely hurt , comes down on him like a ton of bricks . \nat that point we find that she is not only the only person who can put up with him as a matter of course , but is also the only person who can get to him , too . \nanother person who often crosses melvin\'s sights is simon ( greg kinnear ) , an artist who lives on melvin\'s floor . \naside from the fact that he lives near the terror of the city , simon has the added benefit of being gay , making him a prime target . \nsimon\'s friend frank ( cuba gooding , jr . ) , also gay , does not fare much better . \nwhen simon walks in on a pair of men robbing his apartment , he is brutally beaten and sent to the hospital , and frank , who has grown tired of seeing his friend take the verbal abuse dished out by his neighbor , intimidates melvin into watching after simon\'s dog while he convalesces . \nthis is the same dog melvin had earlier shoved down the garbage . \nan interesting thing happens when melvin takes this dog in : melvin gets to like the dog , and the two develop an attachment which is the catalyst to melvin\'s softening up to the world around him . \nit doesn\'t happen overnight , but throughout the film , he bites his tongue here , cares a little there , and most miraculously , falls in love . \none of the best elements of this film is watching melvin try to express feelings which are not the usual negative ones he so often shares with others . \nhe\'s traveling terra incognita here , and it shows . \ngood performances are turned in by all principal players in this film , especially by nicholson and hunt . \nthey play well off of each other and have a genuine chemistry which makes it a pleasure to watch them on screen . \ngreg kinnear , who is becoming known for his supporting film roles , is also very good at playing the vulnerable simon . \nhe gives a short monologue about what it means for him to be an artist , and delivers it with such inspiration and conviction that you actually get to feel some of what he feels . \ncuba gooding jr . performs with a hyped-up level of energy which contrasts nicely with that of kinnear , and comes through with a near constant comic performance . \nthe screenplay , by mark andrus and james l . brooks , is clever , touching , and funny . \nthe best part about it , however , is that it is filled with characters we care about because they are actually interesting . \nmelvin is a man we can\'t quite figure out , but whose mannerisms and quirky qualities capture our attention . \ncarol is a working woman living with her mother , trying to take care of a child with a debilitating respiratory problem . \nsimon is a man who is a success in his circle of peers , but who is still not accepted by much of society . \ncombined with the talent of the actors , these characters make the film . \nthe one noticeable area where the film is lacking , however , is the absence of cuba gooding , jr . through the second half . \nhis character makes an exit which is supposed to be temporary , but the film ends before his return , leaving his relationship with simon and melvin unresolved . \ni would have liked to have seen more of his character in general , in addition to a part in the film\'s conclusion . \nthere\'s one actor , who will probably not be recognized by any awards , but who contributes greatly to many of the movie\'s best scenes and who deserves mention . \nthis is that little dog . \nhe plays such a pivotal role to melvin\'s character development , actually serves to forward the plot , and has some absolutely scene-stealing moments , that it is hard to believe he is simply an animal . \naward or no , however , when even the dog puts in a good performance , you know you\'ve got an outstanding movie . \n'~pos
'the ads for \" batman and robin \" scream \" the event of the summer is here \" and that\'s the problem . \nthe producers were apparently so intent on creating a spectacle that they forgot to put an actual movie inside of it . \n \" batman and robin \" is 126 minutes of lavish sets , flashy costumes and big , confusing fight scenes with barely a hint of substance . \nit\'s like one of those cheesy kings island stage shows ; bright , busy and visually diverting , but not very much fun . \nit wasn\'t always this way . \ntim burton\'s \" batman \" was an epic story of obsession and duality , of darkness and revenge . \nthe film , while far from perfect , was a striking mood piece with an otherworldly feel . \nbatman was a creepy , brooding creature of the night . \nthe joker , brilliantly overplayed by jack nicholson , was at once charismatic and repellent . \nbatman and the joker were opposite sides of the same coin , battling inner demons and one another over gotham city\'s breathtaking gothic skyline . \nthose days of the dark knight are gone , replaced by a psychedelic ice capades run amuck . \n \" batman and robin \" has far more in common with the campy 60\'s batman tv show than with tim burton\'s tale of darkness . \nthe blame lies with director joel schumacher . \na former window-dresser , schumacher is adept at decorating sets and dressing people in exotic costumes . \nunfortunately , when it comes time to have those people walk and talk , he hasn\'t the faintest notion of what to do . \n \" batman and robin \" is overstuffed with intricately choreographed fight scenes so poorly edited that it\'s often difficult to tell who\'s whacking who . \nwhile the characters flail at each other , one-liners and bad puns are tossed about like confetti . \na few carefully placed jokes can set an action movie sailing , but too many wisecracks can undermine the momentum of a film . \n \" batman and robin \" doesn\'t merely lose momentum , it stalls out completely on several occasions . \nit\'s rare to see an action flick as sluggish as this one . \nironically , the parts of \" batman and robin \" that work are the ones showing the characters in street clothing , and most of those succeed because of george clooney as bruce wayne . \neasily the best batman yet , clooney\'s expressive eyes and weary smile gives the character a sense of depth that the script doesn\'t even hint at . \nthe film\'s most effective scene is a tender , quiet exchange between clooney and alfred ( michael gough ) , bruce wayne\'s butler and surrogate father . \nas for the other heroes , chris o\'donnell\'s robin is enthusiastic , perky and horny as hell , while pudgy alicia silverstone is hard to accept as an athlete in her debut as batgirl . \nin a movie filled to the brim with major characters , the decision to add the entirely unnecessary batgirl and elle macpherson as bruce wayne\'s girlfriend is puzzling . \ni suspect the producers inserted the women in an attempt to convince audiences that two guys who run around in rubber suits with built-in nipples , shapely buttocks and huge codpieces are actually straight . \nof course , the real stars of a batman film are the villains and that\'s where \" batman and robin \" really suffers . \nas mr . freeze , arnold schwarzenegger gives his worst performance in years , spitting out a stream of lame catch phrases in wooden fashion . \nlaboring under a ton of appliances , schwarzenegger looks as if he\'s having trouble even moving in his suit , let alone trying to act . \numa thurman fares somewhat better as poison ivy . \nshe overacts terribly in the early establishing scenes of her character ( it\'s apparently a rule in the batman series that before a person becomes a villain , s/he must be a cartoonish , bumbling nerd ) . \nonce thurman transforms into the eco-psychotic poison ivy , she does a nice mae west impersonation as a classic vamp who can seduce men with her breath and kill them with a kiss . \nthurman fails to maintain the character\'s maniacal sense of style though , and ends up merely sputtering her way through the latter scenes of the film . \nthe biggest lesson to be learned from \" batman and robin \" is that more is not better . \njoel schumacher fills the screen with eye candy ; but the technicolor overkill merely emphasizes what a trifle the film really is . \nsome critics suggest that the batman series has run out of steam . \ni don\'t think so . \nmy prescription ? \nfire joel schumacher ( but offer him a ticket to a rubber fetishist\'s convention so he\'ll understand that there\'s no hard feelings ) . \ngive alicia silverstone her walking papers , while keeping clooney , o\'donnell and michael gough . \ncall jack nicholson and michelle pfieffer and beg them to reprise their roles as the joker and catwoman . \nthen , ditch the campiness and , for the love of pete , lose the \" event \" mentality and make a movie instead of a spectacle next time . \n'~neg

'if you\'re the kind of person who goes to see movies just because you long for some of that overpriced theatre popcorn ( butter optional ) , then this is the movie for you ! \nindeed , this has got to be either one of the most unimaginative rip-offs of other recent action movies , or an incredibly unfunny spoof of them . \nit\'s difficult to fathom such insipidness unless you actually watch this film . \nbut at least we\'re warned very quickly that we may regret our ticket purchase , giving us an opportunity to sneak on out and into the adjacent show . \nwhat are the four ingredients of a really bad action movie ? \nfirst , the movie gives us an introductory premise . \nhuge caverns exist deep beneath the ocean floor , and in this area , many ships have disappeared . \noooh . . . scary ! \nsecondly , a cheesy soundtrack tries to connote a tone of mystery , but only succeeds in drowning our ears with an abrasive musical score . \nthird , the main character is a mercenary that delivers goods without asking about the contents of his cargo ( treat williams ) . \nhe operates a sophisticated military-style pt boat and every word that comes out of his mouth is awash in comical flippancy . \nfinally , in the cargo hold , we see those that hired him . \nthey are also mercenaries that have tough-looking haircuts , talk with accents , and try to show how macho they are . \nduring their trip across the stormy sea , their boat suffers an incident and requires repairs . \nspotting a cruise ship in the distance , they make their way to the ocean liner and devise a plan to raid the machine shop , take the parts that they need , and then continue on their merry way . \nlittle do they know that this cruise ship has become infested by some kind of ocean monster . \nyet , they board the ship armed to the hilt with grenades and machine guns that can kill dozens in a matter of seconds . \nthis is nothing more than a by-the-book action film . \ntheir realization of the situation that they\'re in doesn\'t happen until they are in the bowels of the boat . \nthose who are dumb enough to stray off on their own will ultimately get killed . \nthe corridors on the ship are narrow , misty , and provide the kind of atmosphere that all scare-fests must have . \nyet , despite the predictable nature of this film , there are some scary \" boo \" moments . \nbut most of it is just outright silly . \nand this film is unusually gory too . \nmonsters basically suck off the flesh and spit out skeletal remains . \nthere is one particularly neat scene where a monster has been cut apart and reveals a victim that is still alive . \nhe screams horribly as the monster\'s digestive juices continue to slowly eat him away . \nadditionally , it borrows heavily from speed2 , alien and a bunch of other recent films . \nthe mercenaries even run into a lone , surviving passenger ( femke jannsen ) who looks amazingly like sandra bullock . \nto be honest , when i left the theatre , i just had to laugh at how witless the film was . \nit\'s moronic fun at best . \nso , if you\'re hankering for a large bucket of popcorn served with a side of silliness , then this might just hit the spot . \n'~neg
'with more and more television shows having gay characters , and even the infamous \" ellen \" sitcom being centered on the life of a lesbian , the movie industry too seems to be gaining more and more homosexual based plot lines . \nthe birdcage was critically acclaimed , as was this years chasing amy . \nthen along came in & out , and all three of these films are on my top ten list for the years in which they were released . \nit\'s also noticeable that this \" alternative lifestyle \" becomes less and less taboo as the years go by , and it seems that using comedy as a medium is proving a worthwhile effort . \nwhile it\'s a very serious issue to many , it is the comedies that people are flocking to see and that are gaining notoriety . \nbut the way we\'re using comedy to present homosexuality is also changing quite dramatically . \nwhile the gay community was once very stereotyped and used to laugh * at * , it is more and more becoming something we laugh * with * , and when a movie like in & out comes along , it is something that both heterosexuals and homosexuals should be able to thoroughly enjoy . \nit doesn\'t poke fun at the lifestyle , it simply uses it to all it\'s comedic capacity , just as love , sex , marriage , birth , death , and anything else has been . \nthe idea for in & out was born the day tom hanks won his oscar for portraying an aids-afflicted gay man in philadelphia . \nif you remember , during his acceptance speech , hanks gave a highly emotional tribute to the gay community , and even sighted a former gay teacher of his as a major inspiration in his life . \nit\'s a serious and touchy subject , but producer scott rudin viewed it as the setting for a potentially hilarious comedy , and pitched it to screenwriter paul rudnick . \nit\'s true that if this same film had been written by a heterosexual , it may have been more controversial , but because it was written by an openly gay writer , the prerogative was set . \nkevin kline , who only seems to become more and more acclaimed , stars as howard brackett , a high school english teacher in the small , picturesque town of greenleaf , indiana . \nafter a three-year engagement to fellow teacher emily montgomery ( joan cusack ) , a wedding date has been set , and the hubbub surrounding it is almost as big as that surrounding another huge story - greenleaf high graduate cameron drake ( matt dillon ) is up for a best actor oscar . \nthe small town eagerly awaits both events , and both seem quite astronomical , but little does anyone know how much one will affect the other . \nwhen cameron drake is announced the winner , the excitement is heightened as he pays tribute to his high school english teacher , mr . brackett . \neveryone is cheering back in greenleaf - that is until cameron tacks on those three calamitous words , \" and he\'s gay . \" \nthe town becomes silent as the entire population joins in a simultaneous jaw drop . \nthe thing is , nobody , including howard , can understand how cameron came to that conclusion , and such wild and unexpected news can only wreak havoc in such a conservative american haven such as greenleaf . \nnaturally the questions pour from howard\'s fiancee , parents ( debbie reynolds & wilford brimley ) , students , and the high school\'s principal , tom halliwell ( bob newhart ) , and the evidence starts to become more and more obvious : howard is clean , neat , honest , sincere , a romantic , and perhaps the most incriminating fact , he loves barbara streisand . \nthe frenzy isn\'t helped any when camera crews from every conceivable news magazine and \" entertainment tonight \" wannabe show up at greenleaf high the very next morning . \none particular reporter is peter malloy ( tom selleck ) of \" inside entertainment \" , who unlike the collage of other reporters , wants to spend a whole week in the life of howard brackett , including coverage of his wedding . \nthe intrusion is all but welcome by howard , who is going more and more out of his mind with each passing minute . \nit seems that no matter where he turns , a camera is being shoved in his face and questions regarding homosexuality are being tossed to him like frisbees . \nthe dominoes begin to tumble as howard\'s closest friends begin acting different and principal halliwell hints at a possible termination of employment should howard indeed be gay . \nit all sounds very devastating , and it would be if it weren\'t presented with near-perfection by one of this year\'s most delightful ensemble casts . \nkline seems only to improve with age , and he is downright perfect here . \nthe great thing about this film is that every single character has a moment to shine , and they use it wonderfully . \nevery single actor turns in one of their best performances ever . \ndillon has never been so likeable , cusack has never seemed so perfect for a role , and brimley , reynolds , and newhart all provide huge laughs when they\'re up to bat . \nrudnick\'s script is heavily laced with wit and humor , and you\'ll likely find yourself laughing out loud for a solid ninety minutes . \nwhile in & out doesn\'t carry enough to give it four stars , it remains one of the best done films of the year , all-around . \nthe script is exuberant , the actors are absolutely top- notch , and we\'re allowed just the perfect blend of heart-tugging so as not to bog down the laughs . \nit remains a solid comedy throughout its entirety , yet we\'re still allowed a sappily touching ending . \ndespite it\'s subject matter , and one scene that comes almost too close for comfort on explaining gay sex , this is a movie that everyone could , and should , enjoy . \nfrank oz , best known as a voice talent for muppets , directs this film quite delightfully , using all the potential rudnick\'s script has to offer , which turns out to be quite a bit . \ncheck this one out . \nyou\'ll have a gay old time . \n'~pos

'with his last two films - shine and snow falling on cedars - australian director scott hicks has proven his cinematic flashbacks to be some of the best out there , and his latest , hearts in atlantis , is no different . \nits structure - beginning and ending in present day with one long flashback in the middle - is similar to the green mile , which is a bit ironic considering both were based on stephen king books . \nthe parallels don\'t end there , either . \natlantis was adapted by william goldman , who had previously penned the big-screen version of misery and is in the process of working on the script for king\'s dreamcatcher . \neven the film\'s content is a bit reminiscent of mile . \nin fact , it\'s the perfect blend of the feel-good \'60s nostalgia of stand by me ( also by king ) and mystical power hokum of mile . \nking\'s atlantis is a book comprised of five related short stories , but the main focus here is on the first ( and longest ) tale , called low men in yellow coats ( the film\'s title comes from the second chapter ) . \nit\'s set in 1960 harwich , connecticut , where 11-year-old bobby garfield ( anton yelchin ) lives in a boarding house run by his cold , self-centered mother elizabeth ( hope davis , joe gould\'s secret ) , who seems to care more about her wardrobe than her son . \nbobby spends his time with his two closest friends , john sullivan ( will rothhaar ) and tomboy carol gerber ( mika boorem ) , who become something like the kevin , paul and winnie of harwich . \nwhen a new tenant moves into the vacant room , the fatherless bobby finds a male role model in ted brautigan ( anthony hopkins , hannibal ) , a mysterious stranger who is vague enough about his past to make bobby\'s mom suspicious enough to at least momentarily turn her head away from the mirror . \nted teaches his young neighbor about the wonders of literature ( after his cheapskate mother gives him a library card for his birthday ) , dispenses prophetic words of wisdom and even pays bobby one dollar a week to read him the local newspaper and keep his eyes peeled for the low men , a group of people chasing ted to exploit his special powers . \ni won\'t go into what these powers are , but they\'re considerably toned down from the book ( and don\'t involve black stuff flying out of ted\'s mouth , a la mile ) . \natlantis\' present-day setting which bookends the film is based on the novel\'s final chapter , titled heavenly shades of night are falling , and features david morse ( in yet another connection to the green mile ) as a married , middle-aged bobby who learns of the death of both of his childhood friends and returns to the dilapidated boarding house in which he spent his formative years . \natlantis is nowhere near as flashy as hicks\' cedars , which is disappointing but understandable considering the switch from the completely amazing robert richardson to the occasionally amazing piotr sobocinski , the oscar-nominated cinematographer behind krzysztof kieslowski\'s red . \nthe acting is solid from everyone , including hopkins , who never once makes you think of dr . lecter . \nmost impressive are youngsters yelchin and boorem , who both had tiny parts in along came a spider . \nwhile i didn\'t really have much of a problem with goldman\'s screenplay , i do need to point out at least one inconsistency . \ngoldman , for those of you who don\'t read premiere , writes what seems like an annual criticism of everybody else\'s films , carefully explaining why they all suck , make no sense and insult their audiences , while somehow failing to mention the crap that he\'s penned ( like the general\'s daughter ) . \nit\'s mean-spirited but fun to read , mostly on account of nobody else in hollywood having the balls to say anything remotely negative about anybody else in the business ( including michael jackson , o . j . \nand robert blake ) . \nin atlantis , which is supposed to be told through the eyes of young bobby , one would assume he would have to be in each scene in order to have the memory to which to flash back . \nwell , he\'s not , and it doesn\'t make sense . \n1 : 41 - pg-13 for violence and thematic elements \n'~pos

'this is the kind of movie that makes one appreciate disney\'s live- action george of the jungle . \ntarzan and the lost city , the latest attempt to bring edgar rice burrough\'s legendary hero to the big screen , is one of the most inept and ill-timed of any tarzan adventure so far . \nbadly conceived and poorly executed , tarzan and the lost city appears headed for a quick trip to video store shelves . \ni have no idea why the producers chose now to bring back tarzan ; it\'s not as if there are legions of new fans clamoring for his next movie . \nfurthermore , it\'s even more curious that this film is rated pg , which , by definition , rules out any sex or explicit violence . \nand , while i\'m not advocating the excesses embraced by the 1981 bo derek version of the story , tarzan deserves a slightly more adult approach than the one used in the embarrassing production . \nof course , no tweaking of the content to change the rating could have saved tarzan and the lost city , since the film\'s troubles originated with the script and were propagated all the way down the line . \nimagine george of the jungle stripped of all ( intentional ) humor , and you have a fair idea of what this tarzan is like . \nwith its uninspired action and tepid adventure sequences , the film barely registers a pulse . \nanyone in search of a relatively entertaining , family jungle adventure should check out the 1994 version of the jungle book , which uses the same basic elements to much better effect . \nthe only worthwhile element of tarzan and the lost city is the pretty scenery ( which , unfortunately , includes the two lead actors ) . \nthe film doesn\'t attempt to re-tell the origin story ? the thinking is that it has been done often enough . \ninstead , tarzan and the lost city introduces us to lord graystoke a . k . a . john clayton a . k . a . tarzan the ape man ( casper van dien ) several days before his marriage to lady jane porter ( jane march ) . \nhe is living happily in england , enjoying the benefits of being a land-owning noble . \nmeanwhile , in central africa , the dastardly nigel ravens ( steven waddington ) , a self-proclaimed scholar and explorer , believes he has found the way to the lost city of opar , which he calls the cradle of civilization . \non the way there , he and his band of mercenaries do all sorts of nasty things , like burning native villages , to earn the wrath of the locals . \none shaman , determined to stop ravens from unearthing opal , sends a mystical message to tarzan for help . \nwith lady jane following close behind , he returns to the jungle where he was born . \nits patently obvious that casper van dien ( one of the pretty-boy heroes of starship troopers ) was not hired on the basis of his acting ability . \nwith his plastic facial expressions , monotone voice , and complete inability to make convincing animal noises , his range rivals that of steven seagal . \nhis pecs , however , are impressive , and director carl schenkel makes sure that he is given every opportunity to show them off . \njane march , on the other hand , has to keep her shirt on , which may be a first for her . \nsome six years ago , march give a solid performance in jean jacques annaud\'s steamy the lover . \nsince then , she made the career-killing decision of appearing opposite bruce willis in the color of night , which exploited her every acting defiency . \ntarzan continues this trend . \nmarch may be attractive , but , at least judging by this performance , she can\'t act . \nmeanwhile , steven waddington has serious trouble summoning up the menace necessary to be a really detestable bad guy . \ninstead , he turns out to be little more than a nuisance . \nthe story line is pure formula , which has largely been true throughout the years for almost all of the tarzan movies . \nthe problem is that this one seems so childish and lifeless . \nthe romantic elements are all contrived ? in fact , lady jane\'s presence is necessary only so she can be captured and subsequently rescued by her buff fiance . \nthe special effects are truly bottom-of-the-barrel ( including some laughably bad men in ape costumes ? apparently , animatronics were too expensive for this production ) . \nand , of course , as with all jungle movies , there are the obligatory cute animals . \nover the years , the legend of tarzan has been one of the most popular sources for film series material . \nthe most famous ape man was johnny weismuller , but no less than two dozen other actors have essayed the part ( including gordon scott , who is widely believed to be the best actor to tackle the role ) . \nweismuller made 12 tarzan features ; van dien will probably fall 11 short of that number . \nand , having seen tarzan and the lost city , i would argue that the movie-going public would have been well served if he had missed by 12 . \n'~neg

' \" desperate measures \" is a generic title for a film that\'s beyond generic . \nit\'s also a depressing waste of talent , with the solid team of michael keaton and andy garcia unthankfully thrown thankless lead roles , not to mention once-cool director barbet schroeder sadly continuing his string of not-cool flicks -- this thriller is more \" before and after \" than \" reversal of fortune . \" \nthe movie is a big disappointment , and yet it\'s somewhat easy to see what motivated such big names to attach themselves to it -- the premise is both promising and intriguing . \ntoo bad the execution\'s all wrong , though , because the set-up of \" desperate measures \" boasts some rather enticing elements that deserve to be put to far better use . \nsan francisco cop frank connor ( garcia ) is a single parent with a troubling dilemma -- his son matt ( joseph cross ) is stricken with cancer which only a bone marrow transplant can push into remission . \neven worse , the only compatible donor is violent sociopath peter mccabe ( michael keaton ) , currently serving a life sentence for multiple murders and other various crimes against society . \nconnor tries his best to convince mccabe to go along with the surgery ; he\'s at first reluctant , but reconsiders after he realizes he can plan his escape at the hospital . \nwhen he does make a run for it , connor offers close pursuit , but for different reasons than his superiors ( including the crusty brian cox ) -- they want to take mccabe down , while connor needs to keep him alive , or all hope is lost for his little boy . \none misstep \" desperate measures \" makes is in its underdevelopment of matt\'s illness . \nwhat\'s needed are more details as to exactly why mccabe is the only bone marrow match that works ; there would seem to be other possible contenders somewhere in the country , and thus many of the ways that connor endangers the lives of himself and those around him by attempting to keep mccabe alive are just a little too hard to swallow . \ntake , for example , a scene where mccabe is trying to make a getaway by climbing over an elevated passage tunnel connecting two sections of the hospital . \nthe police have their spotlight and guns aimed right on him , and what does connor do ? \nhe shoots the spotlight out so that mccabe can continue his flight . \nconnor knows very well what dangerous deeds this guy is capable of , and yet never seems to think that mccabe will eventually get to and try to harm his son . \nwhatever . \nto be fair , though , the lack of story background is the least of the movie\'s problems . \nfirst and foremost is how cheaply \" desperate measures \" trades the potential of it\'s opening scenes for the routine action ballistics of its final hour . \nonce mccabe escapes , the film becomes the fugitive in reverse and with no thrills . \nthere are countless scenes where the good guys catch up to keaton only to have him grab a hostage and get away . \nalso , the movie is so intent on giving you a hoot-inducing , lip-smacking villain ( the ads have compared peter mccabe to hannibal lechter , natch ) that it completely casts garcia\'s frank connor by the dullsville wayside ; \" desperate measures \" appears to like its antagonist so much more than its protagonist , and the movie\'s head-scratcher of a send-off confirms this . \nthere is some good to be found amongst this mess , particularly in the acting department . \ncast against type , michael keaton\'s understated menace is highly effective . \nalthough he\'s not given much believable to work with , andy garcia plays off a taut emotional chord . \njoseph cross , as garicia\'s ailing son , is surprisingly unsentimental , and marcia gay harden lends solid support as a doctor who becomes a major player in the unfolding chaos . \nthis cast does its best to camouflage the sorry plot as it chugs towards an inevitably happy ending , but most is lost . \nit goes without saying that \" desperate measures \" needs an operation of its very own . \n'~neg
'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \non december 20 , 1996 , amidst all the year-end oscar bait releases from the major studios , miramax\'s genre label dimension films quietly released a sly little ensemble slasher flick titled scream . \nalthough the teen horror market had been given up for all-but-dead in recent years , the film shocked industry observers by scoring consistently high box office returns , eventually topping $100 million domestic and becoming one of the most successful films of its type in history , while delighting audiences by finally presenting a set of knowing slasher flick protagonists who were aware of the all the standard cliches associated with the genre . \nthe sleeper success of scream sent shockwaves through the industry -- suddenly , everybody was looking for hip , inexpensive fright films that might be able to reap similar fortunes . \nthe strategy of casting young tv stars to draw the youth demographic was given a boost . \nscream director wes craven , previously best known as the creator of new line\'s a nightmare on elm street film series , was thrust back into the limelight . \nand scream\'s rookie scribe , kevin williamson , burst onto the film scene in stunning fashion . \nit\'s hard to understate this last point . \nmr . williamson has , based upon his produced screenplays as of this writing ( scream , i know what you did last summer from october 1997 , and now scream 2 ) , enjoyed a meteoric rise to fame , quickly become the most well-known screenwriter amongst the entertainment weekly-reading , box office figure-watching youth culture since -- well , since that quentin tarantino guy ( whom , it is said , has also achieved some renown as a director ) . \nindeed , in a singularly freakish oddity , it is the screenwriter , mr . williamson , and not the director that has been receiving the lion\'s share of acclaim for the success of scream , and the print advertisements for scream 2\'s theatrical release are similarly indicative of his increasing prominence : while the traditional \" a film by wes craven \" drapes the film\'s title in the ads , right below it ( in equal sized font , yet ) reads \" written by kevin williamson \" , an affirmation of the screenwriter\'s contribution to the project which may be unprecedented . \n ( i can envision the board of wga , licking their chops at this coup and counting the days until their goal of \" a film by \" is attained . ) \nand , much like mr . tarantino\'s screenwriting , mr . williamson\'s work is vaguely unconventional , incorporating both contemporary pop culture references and allusions to other films into the dialogue of his characters . \nin scream , they satirically discussed other horror films ; here in the sequel , the characters discuss the relative merits of film sequels . \nscream was written in 1995 during the infamous bob dole rampage against hollywood , and mr . williamson\'s rejection of this tirade clearly influenced the writing in both that film and this sequel . \nwhile the sequel was planned from the outset -- a treatment of scream 2 was included when mr . williamson sold the screenplay for scream -- the basic premise for the film and the reunion of the surviving characters nevertheless seems extremely artificially contrived , and it\'s only at about the film\'s midway point when it becomes engaging . \nlike its predecessor , scream 2 opens with a splashy , eye-grabbing prologue which only vaguely ties into the film\'s principal narrative ; this time around , we\'re following the exploits of a young couple ( jada pinkett and omar epps ) attending a riotously gleeful sneak preview screening of stab ( a running film-within-a-film gag where the \" true life \" events behind the first film has been turned into a movie ) . \nhowever , although it tries hard and has some good ideas -- the nightmarishly enthusiastic audience in the film vaguely reminded me of the one i was sharing the theatre with , and i was certainly thinking about gutting the overly-noisy person a few seats away myself after about fifteen minutes -- the prologue is a pale imitation of the bravura opening sequence in the original with drew barrymore ( where her performance not only convinced me that she * could * act , but was so good that it would rank among the best performances in a horror film that i\'ve ever seen ) . \nthere are too many knowing , hip pop-culture references crammed into the scream 2 sequence , and the setup isn\'t nearly as cleverly frightening as scream\'s ; while the first film\'s preface dizzyingly built up to a final shot that was exhilaratingly terrifying , the payoff here is almost campily theatrical . \nflash to the campus of a smalltown ohio college , where returning characters sidney ( neve campbell ) and randy ( jamie kennedy ) have relocated for their studies and to escape the notoriety from the events in the first film . \nthe murders which open this film result in reuniting the survivors -- single-minded tabloid tv reporter gale weathers ( courteney cox ) roars into town to cover the breaking story , while ever-awkward former deputy dewey riley ( david arquette ) flies in to protectively guard over sidney . \nthey\'re joined by cotton weary ( liev schreiber ) , who was falsely accused of homicide in a cameo appearance during the first film ; his role here is significantly expanded . \nthe film incidentally provides surprisingly little backstory , although i suppose a good case can be made that it really isn\'t necessary -- not because so many people have seen the first installment , but because this is , after all , a sequel to a slasher film : what do you * think * happened to these characters in the prior movie ? \nthere\'s a lot of new faces on the scene too : sidney\'s new boyfriend , derek ( jerry o\'connell ) and her new roommate hallie ( elise neal ) , randy\'s fellow film student mickey ( timothy olyphant ) , gale\'s newly-assigned nervous cameraman joel ( duane martin ) , omnipresent local journalist debbie salt ( laurie metcalf ) , co-ed cici cooper ( ms . buffy herself , sarah michelle gellar ) , and a pair of simpering sorority sisters ( rebecca gayheart and sirens\' portia di rossi ) . \nany of these characters could be the killer -- or for that matter , could be the next victim . \nas is seemingly becoming a regular staple of a kevin williamson screenplay , the narrative is once again framed around the increasingly-flimsy premise of a whodunit . \none problem that scream didn\'t have was keeping you interested in the identity of the killer . \nhere ( and to some extent in i know what you did last summer ) , mr . williamson\'s screenplay seems slightly hampered by trying to turn the identity of the killer into a mystery . \nthe film occasionally becomes so bogged down with misdirection that you can sense it straining at the seams to try and drop red herrings left and right at the expense of its thriller elements . \n ( it doesn\'t help matters any that the killer\'s alter-ego is fairly obvious from the get-go . ) \nindeed , the finale plays as full-out camp when the villain is finally unmasked , frothing at the mouth with glazed eyes . \nthis is one of those cases where the villain goes on such an endless diatribe about their machinations , scheming , and motivation , that you actually get bored listening and just want them all to get on with it . \nwhile the basic setup and premise for the film is fairly contrived , the aspect where it\'s head-and-shoulders above its predecessor is in its suspense sequences . \nthey\'re staged much more imaginatively here ( save for the first post-prologue murder , which is handled in such a mediocre , conventional fashion that it seems to be culled directly from the predictable 1980s slasher flicks that the first film satirized ) , and are much more fun to watch . \nit\'s hard to hold back a smile during a giddy scene where sidney and her companion have to climb over the incapacitated killer in order to escape from a car wreck , and a cat-and-mouse chase involving gale and dewey in a campus sound lab is very nicely staged , although its ultimate resolution is hilariously overblown . \nin terms of its characters , the strong part of the film is the interesting relationship between gale and dewey ( who ambles onto the screen accompanied by his very own theme music ) . \ntheir verbal sparring at the outset provides much humour -- an exchange where dewey defensively rebukes charges of a perceived aura of incompetency is well-written -- and there\'s a curiously endearing aspect about their relationship amidst all the mayhem and bloodshed . \non the other hand , sidney is pretty dull here . \nshe doesn\'t have any compelling presence , and there\'s nothing particularly interesting about her this time around to make us care about her other than that she\'s the returning heroine . \ngiven this , and the fact that there\'s no strong second banana character for sidney ( elise neal\'s role isn\'t nearly substantive enough to adequately fill rose mcgowan\'s shoes ) , it\'s no wonder why the roles for gale and dewey have been significantly augmented for this installment of the film . \nwhat surprises me the most about scream 2 is its zealousness in decimating its cast . \nthe film\'s mounting body count bears out the fact that * no * character is safe ( well , * almost * ) ; while in principal i applaud this bold policy , at some point you\'ve got to be wondering about just how many characters will make it to the next sequel . \n ( i was particularly surprised with the untimely demise of one in particular , whose casting for the next installment of the series would\'ve seemed obvious . ) \nbut hey , as rose mcgowan\'s character said in the first film : \" no , please don\'t kill me , mr . ghostface -- i want to be in the sequel ! \" \nlook what that got her . \n'~pos
'robin williams is a comedic genus . \nthat is , he is one when he\'s in a film that allows him space to move . \n \" flubber \" straps him in a straitjacket , covers him with duct tape , stuffs him in a coat closet and piles furniture against the door to make sure that he doesn\'t get out . \nin a re-make of its own 1961 \" absent minded professor \" , disney offers us proof that more is definitely less . \nrecycling old films ( \" that darned cat \" , \" 101 dalmatians \" ) dressed up as new is the newest money machine from the home of the mouse that roared . \nprofessor phillip brainard ( williams ) is a terminally forgetful scientist teaching at a small college . \nhis fiancee , sara jean reynolds ( marcia gay harden ) , president of the college is none too happy with him because he\'s left her waiting at the altar due to his lack of short-term -- and long-term -- memory . \nshe\'s giving him one more chance . \nhe blows that chance when he invents \" flubber \" ( flying rubber ) and is so excited by his discovery that sara jean is once again awaiting him in her white dress . \nhis tardiness is helped along by his jealous flying robotic assistant who wants him all to herself . \nit\'s not all bad news . \nflubber is a green jello that can magnify and reflect energy that is applied to it . \nbrainard realizes the commercial potential within the goo can save the school from bankruptcy and being taken over by the town\'s evil industrialist charles hoenicker ( raymond barry ) . \nwhile he\'s busy with his new breakthrough , the slighted sweetheart is being wooed by his sleazy rival wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald ) . \nthere\'s a flying car , flubber-enhanced basketball game and an assortment of broken lab equipment : none of which are the least bit interesting or funny . \nat one point , my son looked around the audience and asked \" why are these people laughing ? \" \nalthough williams turns in one of his least inspired roles , he is easily the most lively of the actors . \neveryone else comes across as half-asleep . \nthe re-make is successful in that respect . \nit feels like a bad disney movie from the sixties . \ni remember the original as being charming , but my guess is that the memory from almost four decades ago has been artificially enhanced by the years . \nthere have been some updates . \nfred macmurray\'s flying model t has been replaced by a t-bird . \nhis faithful dog charlie is now \" weebo \" , the hovering robot . \nthe biggest change is that , with sophisticated computer animation , we now can have films show off special effects without being at all entertaining . \nflubber is anthropomorphized into a being supposedly with personality . \nthe gloop has little arms and legs and splits into tiny little gloopettes for a big dance number . \nthis has nothing to do with the story . \nthe only possible reason is to create merchandising opportunities so that kids can badger their parents into taking them to mcdonalds for the toys . \nnot that contributing little to the plot is a big problem . \nthere are very few aspects of the film that move the story and those that do don\'t make sense . \nthe discovery of flubber is going to save the college because brainard can sell his flying car to ford . \nanyone with half a brain would be able to see that his intelligent flying automaton is worth billions . \nit\'s unbelievable that his lover ( well , probably not a lover -- after all this is disney ) starts dating croft after the aborted wedding . \nthere\'s not one appealing component of this man . \nafter the professor discovers that smearing a golf ball with the gunk causes it to bounce uncontrollably around his lab wreaking havoc , i cringed as he picked up a bowling ball . \nthis guy is beyond forgetful , venturing into the certifiable . \nco-writer john hughes used to direct light-weight but thoughtful teen films . \nthe care behind \" pretty in pink \" and \" the breakfast club \" all went out the window after his \" home alone \" franchise heated up the box offices . \nlooking much like \" home alone 3 1/2 \" , \" flubber \" even features a couple of vapid goons who get banged around and a cute little boy who screams a lot . \nin some ways , it\'s difficult to judge this film . \ni have a suspicion that i\'m not it\'s target audience . \nafter all , i measure my age in two digits . \n'~neg
'note : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers . \nbe forewarned . \nit\'s startling to consider that it was only a few years ago that film distributors would worriedly rearrange their summer release schedules in order to give the annual disney animated feature juggernaut a wide berth . \nthe lion king had just cracked $300 million domestic in gross to become one of the most profitable ventures in film history , continuing to build on a sturdy base left by prior flicks aladdin and beauty and the beast . \nsince then , though , disney\'s animated features have shown an unbroken string of diminishing returns , with pocahontas , the hunchback of notre dame , and this year\'s hercules successively proving less and less potent . \nwith the once seemingly-impregnable disney stranglehold on the market share suddenly looking mighty vulnerable , and faced with their first serious competition in the animated film market from fox\'s anastasia , disney has brought xmas home early by dusting off the feature which sparked the modern revival of feature animation , the little mermaid . \nwhile the animation for the film is , as is typically the case for disney films , unquestionably top-notch , the magic in the little mermaid is not its animation , but the wonderful innocence of its story and its rousingly superb music . \nthe film\'s storyline is fairly straightforward -- young teen falls for handsome man , father disapproves and assigns hapless chaperone to his daughter , teen disobeys father and goes to desperate lengths to win her man -- except in this case , the chaperone is a crab , the teen is a young mermaid , and the object of her desire is a human prince . \nwhat makes the little mermaid so affecting and so emotionally resonant is the richness and charm of its characters and the sheer clarity and honest simplicity of their emotions . \nfrom the moment mermaid ariel lays her eyes on prince eric , she\'s resolutely smitten , and she\'s such a pure and endearing character that one can\'t help but invest their heart with her . \nthis simple but touching love story , coupled with a healthy dose of smart humour , makes the little mermaid a remarkably captivating picture . \none of the interesting things about the little mermaid is something which now curiously dates it : the voices cast for its motley crew of characters . \nthis film was produced just before the distracting concept of using celebrity voices became in vogue , which started to a certain degree with beauty and the beast and was irrevocably exacerbated by robin williams\' much-heralded turn in aladdin ; by the release of the lion king and henceforth , the majority of characters in the animated films were voiced by celebrities . \nwhile it\'s understandable that animated features lacking the name-recognition or drawing power of disney ( say , balto\'s use of kevin bacon and bridget fonda , or even anastasia\'s showcasing of meg ryan and john cusack ) would be forced to turn to this strategy in order to hype their products , it\'s unfortunate that even disney has embraced this policy . \ndo we really need to hear , say , demi moore as esmerelda in the hunchback of notre dame ? \nis the film\'s entertainment value really augmented by hearing a recognizable voice , rather than a voice which best suits the role ? \n ( i\'m not exactly on the edge of my seat for eddie murphy in the upcoming mulan . ) \nfortunately , the performers who voice the characters in the little mermaid , although perhaps more obscure , are impeccably cast . \nchief among them is jodi benson , a 1992 tony nominee for her stage work in crazy for you , who voices the film\'s heroine ariel to perfection ; with a wonderfully expressive speaking voice full of youthful vigor , and gorgeous singing voice , ms . benson provides a most engaging anchor for the film . \n ( she\'s the only reason i\'d even consider catching flubber . ) \nsimilarly , samuel e . wright is terrific in the showy role of sebastian , the weary guardian crab . \nhe easily milks his lovable character\'s comic moments for all they\'re worth , and his rendering of two of the little mermaid\'s big tunes -- \" under the sea \" and \" kiss the girl \" -- have become the stuff of legend . \npat carrol is deliciously villainous and vampy as the evil sea-witch ursula , while kenneth mars\' booming voice conveys the stern yet affectionate authority of ariel\'s father , king triton . \nin large roles and small ( edie mcclurg as dotting busybody carlotta is ideal , and rene auberjonois has great fun with his exuberant french chef ) , the little mermaid is impeccably cast . \nof course , the little mermaid will probably be best remembered for its remarkable collection of songs composed by the songwriting team of alan menken ( music ) and howard ashman ( lyrics ) , who had created little shop of horrors and would go on to compose beauty and the beast and aladdin for disney before mr . ashman\'s untimely death . \nnot only are mr . menken\'s tunes unbearably catchy , but mr . ashman\'s charming lyrics are fully integrated into the film\'s storyline so that the songs are a virtual extension of the character\'s dialogue , and consequently work wonderfully within the context of the film . \nmr . menken\'s score for the film is equally top-notch ; the sequence where eric ( voiced by christopher daniel barnes ) and ariel tour his kingdom in a horse-drawn carriage becomes magical and wondrous with mr . menken\'s fine score . \nit appears that most people prefer the delightfully colourful production number for the calypso-styled \" under the sea \" as joyfully crooned by mr . wright , which won the academy award and golden globe awards for best song -- indeed , one of the many little joys in screening the film during its re-release was listening to children scattered throughout the audience singing along with the tune -- but my favourite is ms . benson\'s heartfelt rendition of the ballad \" part of your world \" , an achingly beautiful tune of yearning and hope ( wonderfully lyricized by mr . ashman ) which , accompanied by the film\'s most dazzlingly polished animation sequence , packs an emotional wallop which literally brought tears to my eyes . \nduring the song\'s reprise , which builds to a crescendo with ariel arching on a rock as a wave crashes in , the cumulative effect is nothing short of breathtaking , and one becomes acutely aware that this single instance is one of the finest in animation history . \nas of this writing , november 1997 has come to an end , as has disney\'s limited 17-day re-release of the little mermaid . \nthere\'s no question that the primary motivation for , if not the film\'s reissue itself , at least its timing , was to reinforce disney\'s dominance in the animation market and provide direct competition to fox\'s costly new upstart animation division and their first major venture , anastasia . \nin every respect , the re-release of the little mermaid appears to be a success -- the film\'s 1997 grosses have pushed its cumulative domestic gross over the magic $100 million mark ; the little mermaid proved to have remarkably strong drawing power for a film initially released only eight years ago and in many homes on video , pulling in close to $10 million in its opening weekend ; and although nobody could possibly expect the little mermaid to possibly defeat the aggressively-marketed anastasia in head-to-head competition , it siphoned enough from the fox film\'s opening weekend totals to keep anastasia from the coveted weekend leader spot , allowing for disney\'s odious flubber to sweep in on the subsequent week and wrestle the family demographic market share away . \nbut although disney\'s motives in the reissue of the little mermaid were self-serving and protectionist , the real winner is the public . \nany reason to put this film back into theatres is a good one , and it\'s a true joy to see this heartwarming gem back on the silver screen . \nthe little mermaid is the best film to come out of the disney\'s modern animation renaissance , and one of the greatest animated films ever made . \n'~pos

'this christmas , little ralphie parker ( peter billingsley ) wants nothing more than a red ryder bb gun under the tree . \nalthough cautioned by many that he will ? shoot his eye out\' , ralphie remains optimistic , conjuring up a detailed scheme to get on the good side of his parents and teachers . \nit could be possible that no one has ever wanted anything with more passion than ralphie wants this bb gun , and the story of his eternal struggle is a charming one . \n`a christmas story\' is a favorite among many during the holiday season , and boy , it is certainly easy to see why . \nralphie\'s endless desire for the bb gun may transport you back to your childhood , when you were craving a certain gift for christmas and the anxiety was almost indescribable . \nevoking pleasant childhood memories is only one of the many things `a christmas story\' does so well . \nhere are a few features that make this film such a charming little package for everybody during the holiday season : \n1 ) period detail . \nthis film is based on the memoirs of late humorist jean shepard , who shares his experiences as a young boy living in the 1940\'s with loving detail . \nshepard narrates from a first person point-of-view , divulging his various adventures one snowy december , in which visions of taking aim with his new bb gun replaced that of sugarplums dancing in his head . \nshepard\'s first-hand commentary of several situations is not only downright hilarious , but also witty and warm , with various metaphorical meanings that ring perfectly with the essence of comic timing . \non top of that , young billingsley\'s stupefied reactions to each predicament is absolutely perfect in contrast with the narration . \ndirector bob clark captures the look and feel of the era with wonderful technicality . \ni can hardly imagine a more accurate depiction of what christmas for young ralphie must have been like . \n2 ) mom and dad . \nboth melinda dillon ( as mom ) and darren mcgavin ( as ? the old man\' ) are perfect in their roles . \nit\'s hard to fathom a more agreeable pair for the requirements of a story like this one , with each possessing at least one memorable trait that instantly separates them from the wooden caricatures that could have been featured . \nfor instance , he is a bloodthirsty turkey hound , and she is forgiving and understanding when it comes to some serious issues . \nin portraying the writer as a persistent but mild-mannered young lad , peter billingsley has struck quite the chord . \nhis performance is richly textured , making all of the humorous situations he stumbles into radiate with flavor and enjoyment . \nwhich brings us to . . . . \n3 ) the comic situations . \nthere are plenty of memorable moments in `a christmas story\' . \nmoments that undoubtedly will improve in comic potency upon each new viewing , with so much more to explore and to cherish . \ni am particularly partial of the ? f-word scene\' , in which ralphie blurts out the shocking four-letter obscenity while helping the old man in the yard . \nagain , shepard\'s method of handling this amusing scenario is nothing short of comic wizardry . \nthe numerous sequences that stick in one\'s mind include , of course , the famous department store santa scene - in which billingsley has some problems in telling old saint nick what he wants under the tree . \ni could go on , but i\'ll finish on this note : `a christmas story\' is a standout among holiday movies , because it captures so much in a meager 90 minutes . \nnot only is it funny , it\'s often genuinely hilarious . . . . not to mention warm , fluffy and touching in all the appropriate places . \ni plan on making `a christmas story\' a christmas tradition . \nwhy don\'t you ? \n'~pos

they are all synchronized . \neach story builds to a tense moment ( or what appears to be intended to be a tense moment ) but then lets the tension dissolve . \nwhile the tension dissipates one character starts singing a song and in each plotline the major characters sing along , even though they are not in the same scene . \nthen toward the end the stories each build to a tense moment again . \nit is almost as if the characters are somehow psychically linked . \nthis creates some strange effects . \nthe stories are about empty desperate people with dysfunctional relationships . \nthe strands have varying degrees of bizarre content . \nwe have the story of a dying man earl partridge ( jason robards ) wanting to get in touch with his son and make amends . \nphil parma ( philip seymour hoffman ) is his nurse who is frantic to help partridge achieve his final goal . \npartridge\'s young wife linda ( julianne moore ) is getting more and more anxious as partridge dies , but for

baker hall ) hosts a popular children\'s tv quiz show that really exploits and destroys children as we see from the stories of current quiz kid stanley spector ( jeremy blackman ) and former quiz kid donnie smith ( william h . macy ) . \nthe film juggles all these stories for over three hours , but even after all this time not one story is resolved satisfactorily . \neach story moves toward a single bizarre common climax , but it is not one that seems to do much but derail each story . \nthe common climax itself is ambiguous in many ways and it fails to really tie up any of the stories . \nthe film seems to be built around strange events and weird history , but it really has little to do with the content of the stories , though they all are connected in part by one weird event . \nmagnolia will probably bring some much deserved attention to paul thomas anderson , though in my opinion his two previous films , hard eight and boogie nights were better told stories . \nit is interesting that one starts to look forward to actors from anderson\'s company . \njohn c . reilly seems to be a standard fixture . \nparticularly notable is philip baker hall who gave a mesmerizing performance from the first scene of hard eight . \nhere he several of the characters are mesmerizing , but that characteristic is not really used . \nas studies of characters these stories are each worth following . \nas well-rounded stories with a beginning , middle and end , they leave something to be desired . \nbut the film is willing to do the unexpected and that helps make the film worth

objects can be hurled high into the atmosphere and then be kept aloft by the updrafts for surprisingly long periods of time much as hail and chunks of ice are . \nwhen the whirlwind is over water , animals near the surface , frequently fish and frogs , may suffer the same fate . \nessentially they are vacuumed up by the whirlwind , held aloft by updrafts , and finally dropped elsewhere . \nso while the rain is possible , some doubts do creep in . \nthe rain of frogs depicted in this film may be of greater scale than i had pictured for a rain of frogs . \nit seems unlikely the frogs would still be alive when dropped . \nit is not clear that geographic conditions are right for los angeles to have this sort of phenomenon . \n ( frankly i have no idea on these points . ) \notherwise the event was quite believable . \nwhat we see in this film is much more credible than the phenomena we saw in volcano . \nin the film it is left ambiguous if the rain is a sign from god since there are many references to exodus 8 : 2 . \n \" and the frogs shall come up both on thee and upon thy people , and upon all thy servants . \" \nhowever a rain of frogs , though it feels biblical , is most definitely not a biblical portent . \nnote that the previous verse says \" and the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly which shall go up . . . , \" \nso the bible is referring not to a rain but

'there are some pretty impressive stars in lost in space - it\'s just that none of them happen to be actors . \nthe stars i\'m referring to are the computer generated ones that make up the movie\'s \" outer space \" ; the stars that the less impressive actors hurtle thru as they try to find their way home . \nyes , in terms of acting , the star power is . \n . \n . \nwell , more like a falling star . \nkinda pretty , short-lived , and pretty much dead . \nlost in space , as if you really didn\'t know , is based on the 60\'s sci-fi television series of the same name . \nit\'s the year 2058 , and earth\'s precious resources are quickly being usurped by the needs of its massive population . \njohn robinson ( william hurt ) is the scientist leading a mission program to colonize a foreign planet . \nearth\'s entire existance is contingent upon a successful mission , but nobody , whether it be john\'s family or hired battle pilot don west ( matt leblanc ) , seems too enthusiastic about leaving their home planet for several years . \njohn\'s family consists of his wife maureen ( mimi rogers ) , his atypical teenage daughter penny ( lacey chabert ) , his ingenious son will ( jack johnson ) , and his beautiful scientist daughter judy ( heather graham ) . \ndespite everyone\'s reluctance , the jupiter 2 spacecraft abandons planet earth and makes its way into the vast eternity of space . \nunknown to anyone but the audience , there is an evil doctor stowaway determined to sabotage the entire mission . \ndr . smith ( gary oldman ) has been hired by a group of rebel conspirators to turn the expedition sour , and dr . smith has re-programmed a talking robot to \" destroy robinson family \" ! \nwhen everything that could go wrong does go wrong for both sides , the spaceship is warped to an unknown destination , and now the premise of being lost in space is complete . \nas for the audience , you will likely be lost in boredom by this point , wondering if the plot , like the jupiter 2 , will ever get off the ground . \nit\'s hard to tell who deserves the most blame - the incredibly bland and corny characters or the horrifically lame script ?

'contact is the 1997 movie i\'ve seen the most - five times to be exact . \nfour of those times were on the big screen , but even on a tv , it\'s a very impressive film . \nthe same can\'t be said for films like independance day , but that\'s because contact is a rare example in sci-fi filmmaking where the story is treated more importantly than the special effects , and all of us know looking back that id4 didn\'t offer much outside of some one-time delightful eye candy . \ncontact\'s wonderfully presented story deals with ellie arroway ( jodie foster ) , a radio astronomer whose preference of study involves the outdated technique of \" merely listening \" to sounds out in space . \nher interest in the field of astronomy developed at a very young age , encouraged by her loving father , ted ( david morse ) , who let ellie use a small ham radio to pick up on frequencies and communicate with people as far away as pensacola , fl ( that was , of course , before the days of internet chat rooms ) . \nwhile everyone else uses modern technologies to aid them in the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence ( of which the program seti is an acronym for ) , ellie prefers to pop on a pair of headphones and see what she can pick up on , keeping the youthful magic and intrigue strongly alive . \nellie\'s strong scientific basis essentially makes her an atheist , a belief likely influenced by the death of her father while she was still quite young . \nin puerto rico , she meets palmer joss ( matthew mcconaughey ) , a writer examining the effects of technology on the world\'s overall happiness ; a one- time seminary student who describes himself as \" a man of the cloth , without the cloth \" . \ndespite the vast differences in opinion regarding a \" supreme being \" , ellie and palmer hit it off , and even take the time to sleep together . \nit\'s a weak and hurried relationship , but director zemeckis needs it to add to the plot later on . \nmeanwhile , dr . david drumlin ( tom skerritt ) , who has authority over seti but finds the program a frivolous waste of time and money , is ready to pull the plug on any and all seti funding . \nthis leaves the passionate ellie searching for new sponsors , eventually finding a setup in new mexico and leaving palmer with no explanation , and only a one night stand to remember . \nit is in this nm city where , several months later , ellie finally picks up on a strong signal from outer space , perhaps the most profound discovery in the history of science . \nwhen the signal is closely examined , many new developments spring up , and before long , drumlin is stepping in to take over the operation he once scoffed at . \neventually , it is concluded that information in the signal may be blueprints for a transportation device used to teleport an earthling to vega ( where the signal seems to have originated ) . \nthe media swarms , fanatics go further off the deep end , scientists clamor for new information , politicians huddle in discussion of appropriate actions to take , and presidents are morphed into a celluloid reality ( remember when zemeckis couldn\'t get enough of this in forrest gump ? ) . \nas if that weren\'t enough , ellie\'s discovery leads her to the nation\'s capital where she again runs into palmer . \ncontact is based on the novel by carl sagan and deals heavily with the subject of science vs . religion . \nthe impressive thing is how well both aspects are presented , with no signs of bias . \narguments for both sides are intelligent , solid , and thought-provoking . \nwhen palmer joins a selection committee to choose an ambassador to vega ( of which ellie is a leading candidate ) , personal convictions play a more important role than love interests . \nthe question is , can a person who doesn\'t believe in god truly be the best representative of earth when 90\% of the planet * does * believe in a higher power ? \neven when the film wraps up , it\'s uncertain whether it\'s meant to play as an advocate for religion , science , both , or even neither , and in our modern day society where \" right and wrong \" is only opinion ( at least speaking \" politically correctly \" ) , the ambiguity is an incentive . \ndon\'t get me wrong . \nas much as it sounds like it , contact isn\'t merely a theology class rolled into a reel of film . \nit\'s a * highly * enjoyable two and a half hours . \ndespite its seemingly heavy issues , it\'s not a tedious undertaking to watch this film . \nthe special effects are outstanding , though ( warning ! ) \nhighly depreciated on the small screen . \neven so , some of the subtle visual effects ( that will likely go unnoticed by many ) are even more impressive than ones more recognizable as \" sci-fi \" . \nthe storytelling is rich and complete , and although there are moments in the film that feel quite pretentious ( and at times , even hokey ) , it\'s easily one of the best 1997 films , and one of the best sci-fi films i\'ve ever seen . \nthis is zemeckis\' best since back to the future , and for those of us who actually know that forrest gump was astronomically overrated , zemeckis now has real reason to boast . \n'~pos

( giorgio cantarini ) are a happy family . \nguido has finally fulfilled his dream of opening a bookstore . \nbut racial and anti-semitic tensions are on the rise in italy , and guido has determined to do his best to shield his son from these harsh realities . \nthe task becomes even the more difficult when the family is deported to a concentration camp . \nhere , guido must use all his skill and imagination not only to shield his son , but to keep him from being exterminated . \nit is at this juncture in life is beautiful may tend to offend those whom the holocaust has touched . \nfor the scenes in the concentration camp lack the horror , the pain , the unimaginable suffering of a schindler\'s list . \ntrue , many italian jews were not deported until the war was nearly over , and most were not sent to the death camps , but to work camps where they were used as slave labor . \nunlike steven spielberg , benigni is not out to tell the story of the holocaust . \nhis story is about family and the lengths a parent will go to protect a child . \nfor guido , to save his son , transforms the entire experience into an elaborate game . \ngiosue ? must follow the rules without question to amass 1 , 000 points . \nthe winner takes home a tank . \ntherefore , guido tells him , he must remain hidden in the barracks . \nhe cannot make a sound nor allow the guards to see him . \nguido explains this during a hilarious sequence when a german guard barks the camp instructions to the newly arrived inmates . \nguido , lying that he understands german and can translate for his fellow prisoners , instead lays down the rules for his son to allow him a chance to survive . \nthroughout their imprisonment , guido\'s quick thinking continually keeps his son from harm\'s way . \nultimately , the allies rescue the camp . \nin a poignant scene , giosue ? comes out of hiding just as an american tank rolls into the compound . \nthe boy goes wide-eyed with wonderment and delight , thinking he has won the game . \nthe price for his victory is most high . \nbenigni has succeeded in using the blackest moment in human history to prove that even in hell , a ray of hope and salvation can penetrate the darkness . \nlife is beautiful is a fantasy , a fable . \nit is not to be taken as a record of the holocaust . \nthose who object to it are missing its point . \nand that is simply where there is hope , where there is life and where there is love , the spark of humanity will never be extinguished . \ncommitted to lifelong learning through effective communication \n'~pos

'maybe this mission should have been scrubbed \nmission to mars \na film review by michael redman copyright 2000 by michael redman \nthere\'s a world of difference between artists and technicians . \nthe artist has a vision to create something new . \nhe may not do it well , it might be sloppy , but it\'s something you\'ve never seen before . \na good technician can make it look good , but without direction from his own inner artist or someone else , it\'s going to be just a xerox . \nobviously successful films need both skills . \nbrian de palma is a masterful technician . \nhe\'s spent his career copying others , most notably hitchcock . \nhe usually knows exactly what to do to make a scene work , but only because he has learned it by rote . \naside from rare flashes of originality , his films are often soul-dead . \nin de palma\'s latest , he turns his attention to stanley kubrick . \nto tell the truth , i enjoyed portions of this movie , but i liked it a lot better over 30 years ago when it was called \" 2001 \" . \ni enjoyed it even more when it was titled \" close encounters \" . \nnasa has set its sights for mars . \nwhen the first crew meets with disaster , a rescue mission is sent to the red planet . \nthey don\'t do so well either , but eventually meet up the lone surviving astronaut-gone-rasta and solve the mysteries of the universe . \nand it\'s all so boring . \nthere are so many scenes that just don\'t work , it\'s difficult to begin . \nwhen the first crew is a few feet away from a raging massive upside-down martian tornado ( which looks remarkably like a sandworm from \" dune \" ) destroying everything in its path , they just hang out watching . \nerror . \nthe most interesting character ( and that\'s not saying much ) is killed off . \nerror . \nthe alien is laughable . \nerror . \nthe rest of the characters are the dullest people imaginable . \nerror . \nthere\'s some nice eyecandy . \nthe face on mars , which turns out to be a giant metal thai buddha head , looks cool . \na three-dimensional holographic planetarium is more fun to watch than anything at disney world . \nmaneuvering in space suits outside the ship seems realistic . \nbut there\'s so much more that feels as if we\'ve been there before . \nfrom \" 2001 \" , there\'s the rotating space station , the blinding white room . \n>from \" close encounters \" , they solve a sound puzzle and play it to the aliens . \nthe list goes on . \nthe actors are mostly mobile wooden statues . \neven gary sinise and tim robbins can\'t muster enough emotion to convince us they are breathing . \nno one seems to care about anything that happens . \nyou won\'t either . \nthe absolutely worst sin is the blatant product placement as dr . pepper , with a 20 foot tall logo , saves the day . \nthey should save the commercials for those insipid bits before the film . \n'~neg
'virtual reality is a topic that has almost defined its own genre . \nsince \'dark city\' ( 1998 ) , films about alternative universes and parallel worlds have been coming one after another . \nthe most popular and original of them all has been the matrix . \nall the films released after it , have been less successful . \ndavid cronenberg\'s existenz , released only a couple of months after the matrix , was accepted and even appreciated ( by some ) , but the hype was gone . \nand when \'the thirteenth floor\' aired this fall , it was completely overseen and ignored . \ni admit that this issue has become something between tiring and annoying , feeling like eating the same meal over and over again . \nit was therefore i was less than excited , when i went out to see to \'the thirteenth floor\' . \nhowever , i was positively surprised by josef rusnak\'s latest picture . \nmatrix was an entertaining thrill ride through dreams and reality , combining the best of hollywood\'s action and effects with an intelligent story . \nexistenz was a violent , gory and unsettling journey through reality and virtual reality , ending in blood and madness . \n\'the thirteenth floor\' is somewhere in between . \ninstead of going after the crowds - the action audience ( like the matrix ) , or aiming at the horror fans ( like existenz ) , \'the thirteenth floor\' presents a more intelligent plot , witch will provide a less entertaining and more serious experience , that the true science fiction lovers will find rewarding . \nin a near future . . . on \nthe thirteenth floor of a classified building , a genius scientist , hannon fuller , has created a simulated world , his personal dreamworld , where every inhabitant is a complex , selflearning program that only believes it is real . \nright after the first testing of this world , fuller ( ) is found murdered . \ndouglas hall ( ) , his closest friend and business partner , immediately becomes the prime suspect and must enter through the thirteenth floor in search of the truth . \na beautiful woman ( gretchen mol ) who suddenly appears on the scene may hold the key to the mystery , which might unravel the horrifying truth about his own existence . \nthe first \" download into simulation \" is impressive . \nit is the creator\'s first visit to his world , his creation . \nin order to enter this virtual universe , you have to take over someone\'s identity , become another person . \nthis is called conciseness transfer , and this is part of the tragedy in the film : people \" wake up \" in unknown places and strange things start happen . \nthey start to doubt in their own sanity . \nthese innocent people pay for the mistakes of their \" users \" and creators with their sanity and their lives . \nit is a frightening reality ; the fact that all the people in the simulation ( the program links ) are living out their lives , oblivious , not knowing that they are puppets in someone\'s fantasy . \nwith an appealing ( \" blade runner \" - type ) of detective story , this film presents the beauty and possibilities of virtual reality and the lurking danger that is always present . \nour modern world is metal and glass -- cold , unfriendly , impersonal . \nthe thirties are different -- colorful , beautiful , elegant , virile . \nthis contrast demonstrates a wish for change . \nvirtual reality is here portrayed as a magical , enchanting power that seduces you into its endless possibilities . \nto some it is just a journey to their personal paradise , to some a personal playground -- a life without any consequences . \nfor others - a way to start over and \" correct \" their mistakes , by living in an illusion of their past . \nvirtual reality is a wizard that transforms your hopes , dreams and fantasies to life . \nat least that\'s how it is all beginning . \nbut when you\'re waking up from your dream , the real world seems worthless and unreal and all you can think off is returning to your personal paradise . \nthis , almost narcotic effect , soon turns into confusion and ultimately madness . \nsome important and interesting philosophical questions are raised -- what is real ? \nwhat is thought ? \nwho are we ? \nif these were answered , this film would be the greatest science fiction ever made . \nthey are off course not answered , but posed in an intelligent manner . \nthe visual aspect of the film is one of the key elements , since it portrays the contrast between these computer-simulated universes . \nkirk m . petrucelli has done a marvelous job with the recreation of the thirties with its glamour , grace and color ; and setting this world in opposition to our own -- an almost caricatured recreation of the nineties . \nthere are some honest and decent performances by an almost unknown cast and harald klose\'s moody musical score that is at in right place at the right time . \na rather unusual thing about\'the thirteenth floor\' is the almost complete lack of special effects . \nthere are no cgi animated creatures , no bullets in slow motion . \nthis is a more philosophical approach , reminding about the european way of filmmaking . \nthis is off course a major disappointment to the audience that is used to endless gunfights and mutated amphibians , but the more serious science fiction buffs and \'dark city\'-fans will be pleased . \nthis film is interesting and inspiring . \nit has everything existenz doesn\'t , but it lacks the immediacy and intensity of the matrix . \nand then there is a happy end which , like in \'dark city\' , completely alienates it from the rest of the story and context . \nthe plot itself is not as original as the filmmakers want us to think , since they have virtually sucked out all information from the best science fiction classics , including blade runner and \'dark city\' . \nwith this in mind , \'the thirteenth floor\' doesn\'t make an oscar candidate or a film that will be remembered a year from now , yet this is a beautiful , elegant and intelligent take on virtual reality . \n'~pos
'mulholland drive did very well at the cannes film festival . \nas you can see from the rating it did not do very well from me at the toronto international film festival . \nit may not be clear to the viewer why i am so negative on this film for most of the running time . \nin fact it is an interesting mystery story told on the backdrop of the hollywood film industry . \ntoward the end of the film i think everything that has been built falls apart . \nthe film was to be a pilot for a tv series but writer and director david lynch did not sell his tv pilot and i think he decided that he wanted to do something else with it . \nsomething else is what he did . \nthe film opens with a woman ( played by laura harring ) about to be killed in a car when a car crash saves her life . \nshe crawls away from the accident with a concussion and finds herself a bungalow with an unlocked door to sleep . \nmeanwhile young vivacious betty ( naomi watts ) arrives in hollywood from canada . \nshe wants to build a career as an actress . \nbetty is a little surprised to find a woman sleeping in the borrowed bungalow . \nshe does not know who the woman is . \nshe is even more surprised when the woman awakes and does not herself know who she is . \nthey fix on a name rita for her , but are not sure if this right or not . \nmeanwhile local director adam kesher ( justin theroux ) has problems of his own . \nhe is trying to cast one actress for his new film and is getting pressure from the producers and from crime figures to cast someone else , cammie rhodes ( melissa george ) . \nthese two threads are joined by a third one in which there is a strange and comic murder that goes terribly wrong . \nthere is also a strange character called the cowboy ( monty montgomery ) adding to the confusion . \nin what was probably intended for the television pilot the film opens with a great vibrancy showing dancing 60s style under the credits . \na lot of mulholland drive starts out fun . \nlynch wants you to know he could make an enjoyable stylish film . \nhe just chooses not to . \nas with any david lynch film there is strange material added for little reason . \nthere are no earthworms , but there are some decidedly strange david lynch touches . \nthe film is a little long for the subject matter . \ntoward the end it gets into some heavier violence and sex scenes , clearly not intended for the tv pilot . \nunfortunately some of the most important comments to make about this film would be spoilers . \ni will not mention them in the main body of the review but i give mulholland drive a 4 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low 0 on the -4 to +4 scale . \nmulholland drive spoiler warning . \ni have rated this film fairly low . \nyou should read this only after seeing the film or deciding that you will not see the film . \ndavid lynch is in large part a dark satirist . \nmost of his work is done in familiar genres but in some way shows their underside . \nin mulholland drive i think he is having a laugh at the expense of the crime film genre . \nwhat he does with this film is ( are you sure you want to read this ? ) \nplaying off the audience expectations that there will be a simple explanation for what is going on . \nthe first 80\% of the film he tells a simple multi-thread crime story with clues sprinkled throughout . \nthen suddenly at the end he turns the story on its ear with a large number of clues that appear that they should add up to something . \nthe audience expectation is that they will add up . \nbut he has given clues that are self-contradictory . \nlynch wants the audience to argue about what they have seen afterward and come up with theories . \nin fact , the pointers are noticeably contradictory and until i hear a better explanation , i think lynch is merely playing a joke . \nthere is a visual curiosity that was popular in the sixties . \nmad magazine called it a poiuyt . \nother sources called it a tri- pronged u-bar . \nlook at small portions of it and makes sense . \nlook at the whole figure and it does not . \nthis film is , in my estimation , the cinematic equivalent of a tri-pronged u-bar . \n'~neg

'it was with great trepidation that i approached +mary+ , the farrelly brothers+ latest film . \ni knew the film would be funny--the trailer alone had me laugh harder than the actual comedy i went to see . \nbut i also knew the film would be an equal-opportunity offender , attacking the sensibilities of the politically correct with reckless abandon . \ni figured the film would be raunchy , maybe another lucky escapee from nc-17 hell . \ni may laugh , but would i feel better in the morning ? \ni needn+t have worried . \n+mary+ is the sweetest , warmest , all-out laugh-and-grossfest this side of _animal house_ . \nsurprisingly , the farrelly brothers have walked that very tight line of making a touching romantic comedy on the side , and filling the details with five or six outrageous howlers . \nthey make laughter , the toughest job for a filmmaker to do , look easy . \nthe plot is typical . \nthirteen years ago , geeky ted ( ben stiller ) lucked out in having dazzling mary ( cameron diaz ) go with him to the senior prom . \nas luck would have it , on that very day , he was hospitalized . \nwhy , i shall not tell , but i assure you , it isn+t pretty . \nhe hires a private investigator to find her : pat healy ( matt dillon ) . \nhe becomes one of the great comic villains . \nupon finding her , he too is lovestruck , and so pursues her , lying about his occupation and getting his teeth capped . \nit is only a matter of time before ted finds out that he had been double-crossed , and goes to get her for himself . \nwould the geek get the girl ? \npuh-lease . \nthe ending is pure hollywood ; no surprises there . \nbut the absolute joy in this film is how this simple premise allows for humor in zippers , hair gel , the mentally disabled , the physically handicapped , interracial marriages , homosexuals , skin conditions , serial killers , tanning , and drugged-up dogs . \nthe dog on speed sequence alone is worth the price of admission , and belongs in the film comedy hall of fame . \nand yet , for all the targets that are hit , the film maintains its sweet tone . \nmary , playing the straight role , is as sweet and caring as she is beautiful . \nshe is totally devoted to caring for her mentally handicapped brother , warren ( w . \nearl brown--miles away from the cameraman in _scream_ ) . \nmary+s sunniness carries the film here--it compliments the below-belt gags that come at you . \ncameron diaz makes her totally charming , and the audience respects her , even though women in general do not usually undress before an open window . \nben stiller also fares very well , totally changing his image from his _reality bites_ and _flirting with disaster_ straight men to being a , ( how to say it ? ) , a complete loser . \nbraces , greasy long hair , not too bright , and very very funny . \ndillon is exceptionally creepy , especially with his capped teeth . \nand rounding out the cast is ted+s friend dom ( chris elliot ) , tanning addict magda ( lin shaye ) , modern troubador/greek chorus ron lichman , and mary+s sweet mom , markie post ( where has she been ? ! ) . \nnot everything works . \nchris elliot+s role , skin blemishes and all , becomes merely tasteless and boring . \nthere+s lousy dialogue about eight-minute vs . seven minute exercise tapes . \nand there are long stretches without much going on . \nbut the wait is worth it . \nwhen those extraordinary sequences hit , the entire theater erupted with howls , tears . \nbelly-aches , that in some sequences carried over to the following scene . \nthe farrelly brothers have finally done it . \nyes , there are some raunchy bits , but when it is all over , it+s not nearly as bad as it could have been . \nwhile tasteless , it didn+t cross any lines , at least not with me . \nwhile raunchy , it wasn+t nearly as bad as _porky+s_ or _boogie nights_ . \nand it is sweet enough to be considered a date flick . \nafter the funny but sour _kingpin_ left a negative aftertaste in my palate , comes the funniest sex farce since _a fish called wanda_ . \napproach this with an open mind , and you will reap the benefits hugely . \n'~pos

\nthere are a few reasons that made me unable to throw away the experience with the garbage . \nfirst , we saw the movie on opening night of the first day of operation of a brand new theater . \nthe sound and screen kicked ass . \nnobody in the country enjoyed the movie as much as my audience did ( and i don\'t necessarily mean that in a good way ) . \nalso , there were more than zero scenes where i found myself rooting for the robinsons , or getting caught up in the movie\'s tension . \ni even liked the computer-generated settings . \ni usually prefer to see models or sets , but the cg was more detailed than i\'ve seen in a lot of movies ; it looks like someone spent a little overtime to render some of the futuristic cities . \nalso , gary oldman is never a bad actor , even though he is typecast as a villain . \nwilliam hurt isn\'t too bad either . \nneither actor had a great role , but their performances were watchable . \nand perhaps i shouldn\'t admit this , but something about the tone and outlook of the movie brought me back to my childhood . \nthere is very little swearing or blood ; there is a strong moral message , saccharine though it is ; there is a bit of romance ( whose culmination after 2 hours is a \" real \" kiss -- no sex ) . \nit felt like one of those disney movies that i so looked forward to when i was six . \nthose movies were probably as bad as lost in space , but at the time , they were manna from heaven . \nthat type of moviemaking is a lost art . \nnow for the bad news . \nworst and most unforgivable was the incredibly bad dialogue . \nit\'s squeaky-clean , family fun , trying hard to be as hip as pulp fiction . \n \" you better hold on to your joystick , \" is one such line . \nand when a robinson is called upon to deliver a line about warp conduit thingamajigs , they inevitably stumble badly enough to embarrass even the lowliest star trek ensign . \nsecond worst , and closely related , is the screenplay . \nthe story\'s exposition takes place at a press conference , which allows the writers to explain what\'s happening with the least amount of creativity , effort , or interest . \nonce the story gets going , i do concede a momentary burst of interest once in a while , but on the whole , the situations that arise are silly and contrived . \nwhen gary oldman easily reprograms will\'s pet robot to kill the robinsons , my friend summed it up perfectly : \" he flipped the switch to \'evil . \' \" \nthen there\'s the tone of the movie . \nthe colorado daily said the film would have been more interesting if the central character was will robinson and not his father john robinson . \nthen it could be an adventure movie . \nthey\'re mostly right , except that johnson ( will ) wasn\'t a good enough actor to carry it off . \nstill , that the film has the robinson patriarch as our hero shows a lack of imagination . \njust because a movie is tame enough for kids doesn\'t mean that we have to bow to a \" promise keepers \" notion of who\'s the center of a family . \nmany quality family films have been made with a non-traditional family structure ( fly away home comes to mind ) to much better effect . \nand the politics of the time seem a bit conservative and regressive for a futuristic movie . \nin star wars , the rebels were the good guys . \nwe were rooting for those who were fighting against the system . \nin lost in space , the rebels are the bad guys , a terrorist force that must be killed , crushed and silenced so that our children may live free . \nthat ominous excuse for violence almost makes me sympathize with the terrorists . \nfinally , a few specific details deserve criticism . \nthe movie tells us that the setting is the year 2056 . \nwhy ? \nwhy bother saying what year this is . \njust tell us it\'s the future . \ni bring it up because the tv series was supposed to take place in 1997 . \nsetting a specific date only dates the movie and guarantees that it won\'t be timeless ( not that this movie was really in the running anyway . ) . \nthen there is a scene that shows john robinson checking one of his controls on a chair that rises about fifteen feet on a pole . \nthis silly waste of money reminded me of bugs bunny\'s barber chair , and only shows that the future is a time when spaceship designers haven\'t learned a thing about ergonomics . \none vaguely redeeming quality is that the end credits succeed where the rest of the film failed : it made lost in space look cool . \nthe strong techno beat sampled the cheesiest dialogue and , out of context , made it sound hip . \nthis is overlaid on a cool jumpy credit sequence with interesting distorted clips from the movie . \nbut if that\'s the best part of the movie , i can\'t in good conscience recommend it . \nstill , if you get stuck seeing it , as we did , you might be able to appreciate it if you keep your distance , think of liking bad movies as a child , and bring along your \" bad movie bingo \" cards . \n'~neg
'a standoff . \na man holds a woman , a diplomat\'s daughter , hostage in his embrace , a gun pressed to her head . \na cop , impaired by drink due to his wife\'s philandering , trains his gun on the man\'s nether regions , threatening to shoot . \nanother cop holds his gun to his partner\'s temple , forcing him to disarm . \nthe scene unfolds like a foursome bidding in bridge--upping the ante , signaling tacitly , going for game . \nthe second cop retrieves the first cop\'s weapon , the suspect lowers his , and the woman caught in the middle moves--in slow motion--to safety . \nit is then that the intoxicated officer makes his move , grabbing for the assailant\'s gun . \nthe room turns upside down , a shot rings out , a cop is down . \nshot in the back and paralyzed for life . \nthe young man who found himself in the wrong place at the wrong time is sent to prison for six years for a crime he didn\'t commit . \nstorytelling has always been one of pedro almod ? var\'s greatest gifts and in \" live flesh \" he gives us a twisting , turning , compelling tale peppered with well-written , colorful characters . \ncharacters who find themselves , more often than not , in carefully-constructed scenes like these . \ncharacters played by actors we might not know , but who look strikingly familiar nevertheless . \ntake the ruggedly handsome victor plaza ( liberto rabal ) , for instance . \nbefore he gets out of prison he could easily be mistaken for that almod ? var favorite , antonio banderas . \nwhen we first meet elena ( francesca neri ) , the woman in the middle of the nervous shakedown , she looks like spice girl barbie with her frizzy shock of orange hair , but later tones down her look sufficiently to pass for juliette lewis . \nelena\'s husband david ( javier bardem ) is the cop crippled in the shooting and he wears david schwimmer\'s bemused expression throughout . \nplaying the inebriated cop and his cheating wife are jos ? sancho and angela molina--no lookalikes spring to mind , but they round out the excellent cast . \nit\'s a credit to almod ? var\'s craft that these five individuals cross paths and intertwine with such credulity . \n \" live flesh \" begins and ends with a live birth and the film\'s contradictions come almost as often as the contractions . \nbetween the two childbearings , coincidence , irony , and a hefty dollop of sex form the key elements of this thoroughly entertaining film . \nalthough based on a ruth rendell story , \" live flesh \" is brimming with the acclaimed spanish director\'s high-heeled flourishes . \nwomen are at times alluring and repulsive , their extravagant hairdos and animal print coats providing colorful highlights to the intricately-woven drama , an eye bruised by an abusive husband here , a mouth bloodied by an impromptu delivery there . \nwhile in prison , victor learns bulgarian from an inmate and learns to love the bible , quoting from deuteronomy thereafter not unlike the way by which david and sancho refer to themselves as \" guardians of a sick flock . \" \nvictor\'s pre-fab inheritance is a shambles in a slum resembling sarajevo . \n \" dear son , i got cancer \" his mother writes to him in jail . \nshe dies before he is released and it\'s at the cemetery that victor is reacquainted with elena--redemption , ultimately , substituting for revenge . \n'~pos

'with stars like sigourney weaver ( \" alien \" trilogy ) and academy award winner holly hunter ( the piano , raising arizona , etc . ) together in a single hollywood production , one would immediately identify the film as a potential academy award hot shot . \nsadly for copycat , though tightly scripted and nicely plot , is still at heart , a typical hollywood thriller . \nhelen ( weaver ) , after a traumatic near death encounter with a serial killer , darryl ( harry connick jr . ) , has developed a phobia for being outdoors , so to speak . \nincidentally , helen is also an expert on the subject of serial killers , which make her a juicy target for serial killer wannabes . \na year has passed and strange deaths begin to terrorise the city of san francisco . \ndetective monahan ( hunter ) and getz ( mulroney ) , baffled by the unorthodox methods of killing used by the killer , seeks the professional help of helen , who , as expected was reluctant at first . \ncopycat \" borrows \" a lot from silence of the lambs and in most cases , it did work . \nbut copycat tries to be a little bit more by immersing the audience into the lives of its main characters to give them more believability , this was rather unnecessary as the scenes seem to disrupt the mood of the entire film and also . . . \nmuch of the time wasted could\'ve been used to build up the suspense and injected with drama . \neven so , weaver and hunter act very well in their own departments . . . \nweaver being the vulnerable yet strong-within character ( as in aliens ) and hunter being the short , tough , texan speaking cop ( as in raising arizona ) . \nharry connick jr . , a very good jazz singer , shines as the imprisoned serial killer a la hannibal lecter . \nwhich comes to the moment of judgement ( drum roll please . . . ) . \ncopycat is a good thriller . \nalthough the plot is highly predictable and one can actually predict the rest of the movie after about 45 minutes into the show , copycat survives from the moments of anticipation where the audience are held on to their seats , in anticipation of the killers next immediate move . \nthis worked pretty well and will offer audiences a couple of unexpected jolts . \nnice movie to bring your girlfriend to . . . . \n'~pos
'starship troopers is a bad movie . \ni mean , a really , really , bad movie . \nnot only does it cross the line of bad taste when it comes to blood , gore and body parts shown on the screen , it blissfully jumps over that line , apparently unaware that the movie trailers appeal to an audience of five to fifteen year olds ( of which i saw many in the theatre ) . \nlooking past the appalling sight of overdone violence , we are left with a movie with a thin plot at best , no strong lead characters , a blatant disregard for physics , and a very obvious naziesque theme . \nthat being said , onto the review : the movie starts with a propaganda message from the federation ( who\'s logo bears a * strong * resemblance to a nazi german eagle ) , urging the populace to go off and fight the bugs , who are attempting to destroy earth . \nthe film shows large rallies with young children in attendance , pledging allegiance to the federation ( again , sound familiar ? ) . \nas the movie progresses , we are shown terror tactic training , as a drill sargeant very graphically compound fractures one recruits arm , and throws a knife through another\'s hand . \neventually , the recruits embark on a journey to a location two thirds of the way across the milky way galaxy , to fight the bugs on their home planet . \nas our faster than light travelling \" heroes \" arrive on planet , they drop onto the planet , and burst our of their craft brandishing . . . \n \" what ? \" \nyou say , \" laser beam weapons ? \nsonic weapons ? \nphasers ? \nphoton cannons ? \" . \nnope , they hop out brandishing good old 1997 machine guns , pump action rifles , and tactical nuclear weapons ! \ni guess a lot of physics money r&d went into travel and not weaponry . \nas the assault begins , our group of troopers are seen walking in a straight line through a box canyon . \ntwo members of the group notice rocks slipping and falling above them , and one even sees a streak fly by , but disregards it as nothing . \nthis of course , leads to more massive carnage , blood shed , and graphic depictions of limbs and heads being ripped and severed from their bodies . \nagain , i see that military tactics in the future must have evolved at about the same pace as their weapons ! \nin the end , we see neil patrick \" doogie howser \" harris burst onto the scene in what could accurately be described as a nazi ss trenchcoat , hat , and gloves . \nhe does a vulcan mind meld on the giant slug , and then proclaims that the bugs are scared ! \nthis sets the troopers into a frenzy , as they are now one step closer to completing their goal , total genocide of a species ( again , sound familiar ? ? ) . \ni have tried very hard not to step on and spoil the plot with this review , but given it\'s non-existence , i may have anyway . \ni could go on for pages ripping this movie apart , but don\'t want to bore you too badly . \nin short , i felt as if i were subjected to a mix between a pro-nazi war film with bugs substituted for allies , a drivers education accident scene film , and a complete blank screen ( the plot , of course ) . \ni wouldn\'t recommend this movie to anyone , anywhere , under any circumstance . \ncopyright ( c ) 1997 tim jandt \" > \n'~neg
'no , it is not a bad film , in fact it is so good in achieving its purpose , i actually wished for the film to end itself quickly . \nevent horizon is not your run-of-the-mill sci-fi film , i\'m sure many who have watched this will agree with me . \nit is not even original in that sense , and it does borrow heavily from films like alien , hellraiser and even blade runner . \nthe magic of this film lies in its unorthodox setting and methodical build-up that makes it wonderfully horrifying . \nthe story brings us to the year 2050 , where space travel have since enormously progressed . \nthe event horizon is actually a ship built for a secret experimental purpose ; it has the ability to fold time and space thus making it possible for travelling distances not reachable in a man\'s lifetime . \nthe ship disappeared as soon as it went into operation but after 7 years , it reappeared again within the orbit of neptune . \na search and rescue team led by miller ( fishburne ) is given the task to check for survivors of the event horizon . \nthe designer of the ship , dr . weir ( neill ) follows along to satisfy his curiosity on what actually happened to his otherwise technologically impressive ship . \nevent horizon is a sci-fi horror film , much truer to the word than say , alien would ever be . \nwhile in alien , the crew has to cope with a ferocious creature while encased within tight spaces , in event horizon , the forces which goes against the crew is undefined but yet so powerful and horrifying . \nthe story unfolds itself slowly and the suspense buildup is superb , up till the point where i really felt like saying out loud `enough ! \ni can\'t stand this anymore ! \' . \nthere are more than enough jolts to send your adrenalin pumping overtime . \nthe story in itself is not exactly something very exciting and also , the acting is only at most , average by most commercial standards . \neven so , the essence of horror is carried out very well in this film , thanks to its well-paced storytelling , disturbing set designs and some really gory sequences ( which incidentally , has been quite generously removed by our censorship board ) . \ndirector paul anderson ( who did mortal kombat ) and his team of `atmosphere\' creators have done well in keeping event horizon within the bounds of the term `horror\' . \nthis picture did not do very well in the us box-office most probably for the dread-factor impact it has on most audiences ; people will not see it again and not many would recommend their friend to watch this . \nalthough on the face of it , event horizon is mostly molded for mass-entertainment ; many thrills , spills and suspense to keep audiences in focus . \nhowever , the offbeat horror element which it ultimately convey audiences is very disturbing . \nmy friend and i could not say a word to each other for quite a while after going through the `experience\' of event horizon . \ni guess it was just the immense feeling of dread which the film had cast upon us . \nbe forewarned , this film is not for the faint-hearted nor for pure entertainment . \nbe prepared to be disturbed if you should decide to watch this film ! \nevent horizon is highly recommended ? ? but at your own risk ! \nit has been a long time since good-horror embraced the big screen , and event horizon is one . \n'~pos
'capsule : one of the ten worst movies ever made . \nchristopher lambert vs . evil ninjas in modern-day japan . . . \nand nobody wins . \nthe hunted is such a bad movie , so completely inept and so totally brain-damaged that i could almost feel affection for it . \ni could see myself showing this movie to friends and getting a good jolly guffaw out of it , if it weren\'t also insanely xenophobic and insulting . \nchristopher lambert plays a computer-parts salesman who\'s on business in japan . \nhe meets a slinky young woman ( joan chen ) and has a torrid night of lovemaking with her -- and then manages to witness her death at the hands of an evil ninja clan and their leader ( john lone ) . \napparently they had some unfinished business that could only be concluded with her getting slaughtered . \nsince lambert is a witness , he\'s of course the next one to die . \nlet\'s stop and think about this for a second . \nif lambert were in real life being chased by fanatical devotees to a ninja secret society , he\'d have a lifespan you could only measure with an atomic clock . \nin this movie , the ninja manage to kill just about everyone except him . \ni imagine the japanese gods smiled down on lambert and provided him with a goof field that radiates out about ten feet from his body . \nyou know what a goof field is : that invisible zone in which anyone who has intent to do harm to you becomes a klutz no matter what their real dexterity is . \nthis is , of course , only the beginning of the movie\'s problems . \nlambert eventually finds pseudo-safety with a long-haired modern-day samurai ( yoshio harada ) and his partner -- yoko shimada , who you may remember as lady toda buntaro in shogun . \nthey are the two best things in the movie ; in every scene they have authority and presence , and they actually look like they belong here , even when dressed in full samurai armor and wielding bows . \nthe script doesn\'t know what the hell to do with them . \nlone , as the bad guy , is zero-dimensional . \nthe only bad-guy cliche he has to wallow around in is the one about how the bad guy always has exotic women dripping off of him . \nin the hunted , this is elevated to the level of an insulting stereotype . \nwhat\'s funny is that the peripheral characters in the hunted are not sterotypes -- there\'s a nice little scene with a tokyo cabdriver , and a girl in a pachinko parlor -- but many of the main characters are unsalveageably hateful . \nalso , the phenomenal instrumental troupe kodo has assembled a superior soundtrack -- get the cd -- that manages to survive despite the drek it\'s been designed to accompany . \nthere is an extended battle scene in the middle of the movie that is almost reason enough to watch the whole thing -- a gory , excellently staged fight on the bullet train that shows some real imagination for a moment , and then smothers it by trying to clumsily re-couple the whole thing with the movie\'s relentlessly stupid plot . \nby the time we get to the final showdown , with lambert getting to wield his own sword ( which , judging from the ham-handed editing of one scene , was forged in seven hours or so ) , we no longer care . \nwe\'re not even given any definitive information about whether or not one of the key characters lives or dies ! \nsomeone once said that the key to good art -- good movies , good books , whatever -- is to start somewhere interesting , end up somewhere interesting , and show respect for the audience all along the way . \nthis movie bungles two out of three , badly . \n'~neg
'capsule : earthy , experimental , difficult , shockingly frank ( even for 1997 ! ) , and ultimately refreshing story of a black man on the run from the cops . \nthe first few minutes of sweet sweetback\'s baad asssss song ( yes , i checked -- that\'s the correct number of ss ) are without dialogue , just eerie montages of sounds . \na young boy , obviously malnourished , is taken in and fed up by several loving mother-surrogate figures . \nthen one of them takes the boy to bed for a sexual initation ( underneath the title credits ) that\'s far more confrontatory and shocking than any ten basic instincts -- probably because it has the directness and clumsiness of real life , something we\'re not used to seeing on screen . \nthis is one tough movie to swallow , no matter who you are , but that probably reflects more on how pallid and unchallenging movies have gotten lately . \n ( i suspect the sex scenes in movies like el topo and salo would probably melt the synapses of most modern audiences . ) \nthe plot is simple but not simpleminded . \nsweetback , hassled by two white cops who are apparently just looking for an excuse to beat up on a black man , breaks his bonds and runs like hell . \nalong the way he moves through a good many of the kinds of environments that we are only just now being seen in a more serious light in the movies -- or at all , for that matter : the slums , the missions , the ghetto . \nin other , lesser , movies , sweetback would be machine-gunning everything in sight and the end credits would roll over a pile of bodies ; in this one , we get taken on a kind of a tour of the depressing and anarchic world that sweetback takes for granted . \nssbas first appeared in 1971 and was promptly rated x ( \" by an all-white jury \" , as director melvin van peebles crowed in his legendary ad campaigns ) , and it\'s hardly surprising why . \nthere\'s a good deal of sex in the movie , but it\'s handled in a way that\'s unsettlingly frank -- a frankness that spills over into the rest of the movie . \nin one scene , sweetback visits a friend\'s house in the hope of getting sanctuary there , and the other man chats him up while on the toilet . \nwe\'re not used to coming this close to people in real life , let alone in the movies -- especially not people who are not made out to be glamorous . \nthe movie is also full of experimental stylistics that are relatively unused today , but probably because of that seem curiously fresh and new in van peebles\' hands . \none scene , in which a man is interrogated by the cops , is loaded full of menacing energy as they fire off a gun inches from his ears , and suggest his deafness through a cleverly edited soundtrack . \nanother note : ssbas is not so much anti-white ( that would be too easy ) as anti-authority , and as the movie goes on to demonstrate , authority exists in many forms -- governments , churches , and even the paranoid inside of one\'s own mind . \nssbas is ultimately about thirsting for freedom -- and it looks like we could use a little more of that in our movie diet , god knows . \n'~pos

'a fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july ! \ni didn\'t really expect very much when i rented stuart saves his family . \nthe movie bombed at the box office , and i had never really liked the saturday night live sketch on which the movie was based . \nmy real concern , though , was the general reputation of snl-related movies translating to the big screen with less-than-stellar results ( half-baked , anyone ? ) \ni was surprised to discover a truly entertaining , often hilarious yet also touching little film . \nit is an al franken production through-and-through , who not only created the title character but also wrote and starred in the picture . \nfor those of you who don\'t know , al franken plays a guy named stuart smalley , who has a really annoying show on a public-access station about increasing your self-esteem , etc . although not a licensed therapist , stuart smalley is , as the program proudly boasts , \" a graduate of several 12-step programs . \" \nstuart is doing well enough with his tv show , but he keeps getting distracted by family troubles . \nstuart\'s relatives are a mess : his dad and brother ( harris yulin and vincent d\'onofrio , respectively ) are alcoholics , his sister is overweight and getting over another divorce , and his mom is in constant self-denial and solves all perceived problems by baking . \nthen , disaster strikes . \nstuart accidentally insults the manager of the station and gets his show revoked . \nhe is forced to move back in with his family after he can no longer support himself , and there the comedy truly picks up . \nfranken wrote all of the characters not just as cliches or stereotypes , but as sharply-drawn , real people . \nalthough smalley\'s dad has always imbibed too much , stuart can still recall times when his father seemed like an okay guy . \nalso , after an accident towards the end of the movie , both stuart and the audience learn that there is more to his mother than previously thought . \nalthough filled with small , very funny scenes , stuart saves his family also has its share of dramatic moments , especially towards the conclusion . \nfor a lightweight comedy , it handles these scenes especially well , often better than many so-called \" serious dramas \" of today . \nall the more amazing is that such a movie comes from a saturday night live sketch that is essentially a one-joke bit . \nif you feel like renting a comedy , and you haven\'t seen this film , i definitely recommend you try this one out . \nyou\'ll laugh . . . you\'ll \ncry . . . . it\'s \nall there . \n'~pos

'starring ben stiller , elizabeth hurley , maria bello , janeane garofalo screenplay by david veloz , based on the novel by jerry stahl directed by david veloz \npermanent midnight is a pretty bad movie , though it took me a few days to conclude this . \nthe film is more masturbatory than bleak , with its main character intent on confounding us with his stupidity . \n ( he has a $6000 a week drug habit . ) \nultimately , as adapted by veloz , jerry stahl comes off as one of those playground braggarts who chainsmokes at the age of twelve ; you are less mystified by his self-destructive nature than bored into a stupor yourself . \nben stiller plays stahl , a young author who arrives in l . a . with ambition and a nasty drug habit . \nhe eventually gets a gig for $5000/week writing for a sitcom called mr . chompers ( a thinly veiled stand-in for \" alf \" : chompers looks just like alf except he\'s blue ) , marries a producer ( hurley ) so she can get a green card , and hooks up with a spanish mother ( liz torres ) , who shoots heroin with him in the afternoons . \ninsert proverbial downward spiral here . \npermanent midnight is structured mostly as a flashback , with recovering addict bello meeting stiller ( at a fastfood restaurant , where stiller works the drive-thru as part of rehab ) , taking him back to a hotel , and between bouts of serious screwing , listening to his life story . \ni\'ve spent the last week trying to figure out why stiller never seemed to find the frighteningly gorgeous hurley attractive-worse , i\'ve been trying to figure out why hurley did find stiller attractive . \nas stahl , stiller displays none of the charm or wit one would expect ( post-there\'s something about mary ) of either the actor or a comedy writer . \nwhat separates stahl from the hundreds of other hollywood punk-junkies , it seems , is that stahl wrote a book about his idiocy . \nwatch stahl shoot heroin next to a baby ! \nwatch stahl spoil numerous pitch meetings with smack-fueled babble ! \nstiller gives a technically flawless performance : the film could double as a documentary on how to be a junkie . \nbut permanent midnight is mostly soulless . \nwhen the movie poses the question will stahl be saved ? \nand then answers it in the form of bello\'s character ( basically a shrink in black panties ) , could a person care less ? \nin the film version of his autobiography of the same name , stahl doesn\'t need saving , he needs someone who will sit there and listen to him go on about himself . \nif you learn anything about the other characters in this movie , it\'s that they are the most incredibly tolerant hollywood-types known to man . \n ( stahl also seems to be the only person at schmooze parties doing drugs . \nis this hollywood . . . california ? ) \ni learned very little about the entertainment business from permanent midnight and a whole lot about an egotistical lunkhead . \nof course you know that stahl triumphed because he lived to talk about his problems . \nso , basically , his drug habit got him a book deal , a movie based on his life , and now he\'s apparently collaborating with stiller on future projects . \nso much for the moral of that story . \ntemporary midnight is more like it . \n-bill chambers ; september , 1998 \n'~neg
'i don\'t know how many other people have had the idea cross their mind that their life could be an ongoing television show watched by another world of people , but it\'s something i used to wonder about when i was younger . \ni can\'t decide if i first thought it because i watched a lot of tv or because my brother hit me in the head with a baseball bat , but i\'m pretty sure andrew niccol , screenwriter for the truman show , has had the same curious thought . \nthe truman show is about a man ( jim carrey ) whose entire life has been engineered by a corporation and marketed to the public . \nsince birth , he\'s been living in the fictional island town of seahaven , fla . , which actually exists as a giant domed set just beyond the hollywood sign . \nall the people in truman burbank\'s life are actors , and the anonymous townfolk paid extras . \npeople watch truman\'s life 24 hours a day , live , with no commercial interruptions . \nrevenue comes instead from product placement , a staple of contemporary hollywood , with truman\'s friends and relatives describing their consumer items in cheerful and optimistic tones . \nthe sun rises and sets on cue and everyone likes everyone else . \neven if you haven\'t seen the truman show , you\'ve probably learned most of the crucial details from the commercials , the trailer and other promotion blitzes . \nif anything i\'ve written so far is a surprise to you , then i pity you for making me a primary source for your entertainment news . \neither way , you should probably know the premise of the truman show going into it , because otherwise you\'ll probably think it sucks . \nit begins with jim carrey looking into a mirror , reciting the crucial \" eat me \" scene from alive , wishing his neighbors a good day , afternoon and evening , and living in domestic bliss with his wife ( laura linney ) . \nbut weird things start happening . \na stage light comes falling out of the sky , truman hears people tracking his movements on the radio and he swears he sees his dead father . \nwe learn through a flashback that his father drowned when truman was a child , sailing through a rainstorm . \nthe death was staged by director christof ( ed harris ) , who wanted to put a fear of water into truman to keep him from leaving the island . \nsimilar cruel manipulations keep him from stumbling upon the truth , not the least of them truman\'s best friend marlon ( noah emmerich ) , who assures him he\'s not in on any conspiracy because the last thing he\'d ever do is hurt him . \nas truman\'s trusting eyes tear over , christof fades up emotional synthesizer music for a worldwide audience of people who apparently never watch anything else . \nthere\'s even a daily behind-the-scenes update from harry shearer that captures the highlights of truman\'s existence . \nthe key to a movie like this is in finding the right balance between humor and drama , because a premise like this has its obvious implications in both directions . \nand it all hinges on carrey , who has to balance comic naivet with a real sense of longing and drive to find out what the hell is going on . \nhe\'s come a long way from talking butt cheeks in ace ventura . \nmost fundamentally , it\'s just plain interesting to follow along as director peter weir shows us just how they can capture a person\'s life without the person realizing it -- how they coordinate extras , hide cameras and feed automatic lines to actors . \nthe most interesting thing about the truman show is that most of us can probably imagine some ambitious director pitching a show like this . \nsure , the most interesting tv genre of the \'90s has been reality programming and jerry springer\'s popularity is through the roof , but those people deserve to be humiliated for turning their intimate details over to the airwaves . \nand when news shows use hidden cameras , it\'s done in the name of the greater good , not entertainment . \nbut merge the two and you\'ve got the truman show . \nright now , it\'s implausible -- i mean , the fcc won\'t let you say the s-word on the air ; do you think they\'d let you broadcast every detail of a man\'s life to the entire world without his consent ? \none day , though , it could happen . \nand , even though it would mean the end of privacy , people would eat it up . \nyou know they would . \n'~pos

'as with any gen-x mtv movie ( like last year\'s dead man on campus ) , the movie is marketed for a primarily male audience as indicated by its main selling points : sex and football . \nthose two items , wrapped in a guilty-pleasure package , are sure to snare a sizeable box office chunk initially , but sales will decline for two reasons . \nfirst , the football sequences are nothing new , nor can they be ; the sports genre isn\'t mainstream and it\'s been retread to death . \nsecond , the sex is just bad . \ndespite the appearance of a whipped cream bikini or the all-night strip-club party , there\'s nothing even remotely tantalizing . \nthe acting is mostly mediocre , not including the fantastic jon voight . \ncultivating his usual sliminess , voight gives an unexpectedly standout performance as west canaan coyotes head coach bud kilmer . \nkilmer is the driving force behind the coyotes\' twenty-two conference championships and two state titles in thirty years ; this year he plans to make it twenty-three . \nunfortunately , when his star quarterback , lance harbor ( paul walker ) , goes down for the count , he\'s got to rely on the unreliable abilities of backup john moxon ( james van der beek ) . \nmoxon leads the team through its last four games , and then must cope with his newfound stardom , the effect it has on his relationship with girlfriend julie ( amy smart ) , and other temptations that abound in football-crazy west canaan . \nmost regions of the country are not nearly as football-crazy as texas , and so the atmosphere is likely to be lost on most . \nsimilarly , the set design is wrong for a high school setting : the teams are decked out with sparkling uniforms , radio headsets ( which never seem to work , however , and instead require coaches to signal plays manually ) , and even a giant bronze statue of coach kilmer . \nthese elements ( as well as the heavy drinking and carousing ) might be more appropriate on a college campus -- but mtv\'s core audience is the high school demographic . \nthis focus is further emphasized by the casting : james van der beek , of tv\'s \" dawson\'s creek , \" is an understandable choice for the reluctant hero , although he never manages to do anything with the role . \nother stars are similarly young and unmemorable . \nthere\'s not much that goes right about varsity blues , and there\'s not much to like about it , either . \neverything herein has already been done , and if it hasn\'t , the movie manages to botch it one way or another . \nthis is certainly missable . \n'~neg
'i saw simon birch in a basically sold out theater , on a sunday afternoon . \nwhen the movie was over and the audience was exiting , i didn\'t hear one negative comment , and i didn\'t have any to offer . \nsimon birch is primarily about the friendship of two twelve year old boys , simon ( ian michael smith ) and joe ( joseph mazzello ) , and what destiny holds for both of them . \nsimon is a dwarf , who was not supposed to last through the night after birth due to a weak heart . \nsurprisingly , he does , and now constantly reminds everyone that he is a living miracle . \nsimon thinks god has a plan for him , a purpose for his life , and his condition , he just doesn\'t know what . \njoe is an illegitimate child ( referred to both comically and dramatically throughout the film as a bastard ) , who\'s mom ( ashley judd ) won\'t tell him who his father is . \nsimon has more than just dwarfism as a problem , the people in the town don\'t really like him , because he isn\'t \" natural \" . \neven his own parents don\'t care about him , and are disappointed they didn\'t have a \" normal \" son . \nhe is also harassed in church by the local pastor , rev . russell ( david strathairn ) and simon\'s chain smoking sunday school teacher played by jan hooks . \nthe only person , other than joe , that really cares for simon is joe\'s mom , who he also looks up to as a mother . \nit would be just simon\'s luck , that he would accidentally kills joe\'s mom , something you are told at the beginning of the movie . \njoe , now motherless as well as fatherless , feels the need to find out who his real father is . \nwith the help of ben ( oliver platt ) , the local drama teacher and joe\'s mom\'s current boyfriend ( before her death ) , he will attempt to locate his dad and get in a little trouble on the way . \nmost of this trouble is laugh out loud funny , although not all of it is . \nsimon will also look for god\'s plan for him , although he loses a little faith along the way . \nstarring in the first ( and last ) five minutes of the film is hollywood\'s newest dramatic actor , jim carrey . \njim plays the adult version of joe and does a impressive job starting the film off , and then tying it up just right . \nthis is the first character jim has played that is not over the top in anyway , and he does a commendable job . \nsimon birch is written and directed by mark steven johnson , this is his first film as director , but he has written several films , including the grumpy old men series . \nhe does an outstanding writing and directing job here , the film\'s structure is flawless and its flows together perfectly . \nthe dialog goes from extremely funny to morose without missing a beat . \nthe cast is excellent . \njoseph mazzello gives the stand out performance . \njoseph is outstanding for someone of any age , not alone someone who just turned 15 . \nian michael smith , in his film debut , has such a strong physical presence that you believe he is simon without any hesitation . \nother great performances are turned in by the rest of the supporting cast . \ni loved this movie , it is far and away one of the best films i have seen all year . \ntake your whole family to see simon birch , it is a magnificent film- an american masterpiece . \n'~pos
'nicolas cage comes up with an ingenious survival mechanism for his role in the wink-and-a-concussive-nudge bombast-o-rama con air . \nthe opening credits sequence introduces us to cage as cameron poe , a gulf war veteran convicted of manslaughter and serving eight years in prison after an ill-fated bar-room brawl . \nthe prison scenes are accompanied by voice-overs in which poe , in a languid southern drawl , describes prison life to his wife back home and offers simple homilies for the daughter he has never met . \nif the scene gives you a tickle of familiarity , it probably should . \ncage appears to realize that con air is going to be utterly dim-witted and ridiculous , and that he\'s going to have to do something to keep himself entertained . \nand thus he slips into a familiar , surreal role as his own commentary on the proceedings -- cage plays cameron poe as a buffed-up version of raising arizona\'s h . i . mcdonnough . \ncage should have known what he was getting himself into . \nhe got a paycheck from jerry bruckheimer last year for the rock , and if there\'s one thing you can count on from a bruckheimer production ( even without his late partner don simpson ) , it\'s that you can count on seeing everything you saw in the _last_ bruckheimer production . \nthe critical difference between the rock and con air is cage\'s performance . \nin the rock , cage appeared to be having the time of his life jumping into the action fray for the first time . \nthat sense of discovery has been replaced by a wry self-awareness . \nwhile the plot of con air finds poe a parolee on board a hijacked prison transport plane whose goal is just to get home , cage\'s goal is different but just as simple : to get out of the film with some measure of dignity intact . \naudiences , too , should know what they\'re getting themselves into with a bruckheimer production . \nin fact , the marketing people are counting on it . \nno one who loathed the rock for its swear-grunt-blast repetitiveness will be converted by con air ; no one who loved the rock for exactly the same reasons will be dissuaded . \ndirector simon west ( yet another tv commercial auteur plucked by bruckheimer from the advertising equivalent of the schwab\'s soda fountain ) delivers exactly the kind of adrenaline/testosterone cocktail which could launch an endocrinology lecture ( it\'s perversely appropriate that one sympathetic con spends most of the flight nearing a diabetic coma ; like insulin , con air does the work of a gland ) . \nwhat he doesn\'t deliver is a moment of suspense . \na bruckheimer film has no use for hitchcock\'s notion that showing you the bomb under the desk creates a more interesting scene than just blowing up the desk ; a really , _really_ big desk and a really , _really_ big bomb will serve the purpose nicely . \nif either west or bruckheimer were interested in genuine tension , they might have done something with con air\'s creepiest set-up . \nat a desert stop for the plane-load of convicts , serial killer garland greene ( steve buscemi ) wanders of into a trailer park where he meets a little girl having a tea party in a drained swimming pool . \ntheir tete-a-tete is eerie and menacing , providing a welcome shift in tone and giving buscemi a chance to stand out in a cast with too many villains ( danny trejo , ving rhames and a characteristically reptilian john malkovich among them ) . \nin fact , con air usually opts for too much of something when the tiniest measure of restraint would have been an improvement -- too many characters , too much editing , too many dopey punch lines , too much of the cheap , ugly appeals to machismo which characterize too many bruckheimer efforts . \nit is that kind of exhausting excess to which cage is responding with his detached performance . \nwhile malkovich goes for the outrageous and john cusack ( as a u . s . marshal ) goes for earnest , cage looks like he just wants to go to sleep . \nhis recycled raising arizona performance is a means of escape , his chase after a stuffed bunny a continuation of his pursuit of that big box of huggies . \nit doesn\'t bode well for cage\'s appearance in face/off later this month ; perhaps he already realizes that all he can do in action films is more of the same over and over . \nthere\'s a word for people like you , nicolas . \nthat word is called recidivist . . . repeat \noffender . \n'~neg
'the saint was actually a little better than i expected it to be , in some ways . \nin this theatrical remake of the television series the saint , and its series sequel the return of the saint , val kilmer plays simon templar , an elusive thief who makes a living by stealing things from others for others . \nthis movie closely resembles a james bond flick . \nit has the classic bond symbols : a man who can do just about anything and get away with it , a woman whom the man persues , a villain out to achieve something for himself who kills anyone to reach this goal . \nkilmer actually provides a rather good role in this movie , although at times you are left to ponder how he actually gets out of the many tight situations . \nthe movie begins in his childhood in a strict school run by catholic priests . \nas a young boy , kilmer\'s character enjoyed magic and would often journey away from his schoolwork . \nthat is until his school teacher finds him reading a book and demands that the young boy proclaim his name , that of a catholic saint . \nhe refuses to do so and instead announces who he wishes to be . \nthis leads to a devestating mistake , which is something that will stay in his mind throughout his life . \nkilmer\'s first mission that we are shown is to steal a microchip from ivan tretiak , played by rade serbedzija . \nduring a press conference , he must make his way into a heavily guarded vault area , avoiding guards , cameras , and many other potential obstacles . \nonce his mission is completed and he is safely home , the fee is paid . \nwhen he logs into his bank account and finds that he is only a few million dollars short of $50 million , he decides to carry out only one more mission , then retire . \ndr . emma russell , portrayed by elisabeth shue , has discovered a way to produce energy by way of cold fusion . \nthis new advancement would change the world and save thousands of lives in the areas of russia , where millions are without heat and are freezing to death . \nthe only problem is , tretiak would like to have this for himself and use it to gain power amongst the people . \nthis presents the option for kilmer to achieve his goal . \ntretiak hires him to steal the equations , small pieces of paper , from shue . \none of the enjoyable features in the film is the disguises that kilmer dawns to complete his missions . \nthey are very convincing , not only to the characters in the movie , but to us . \nkilmer utilizes one such disguise to lure shue\'s character into getting to know him even more , which would provide him a means of stealing the energy formula . \nwhen the two meet , and end up having a sensual experience , kilmer\'s character is seemingly falling in love with emma russell , as she is falling in love with kilmer\'s alter-ego , a traveling artist . \nyet , he must reach his goal of $50 million , which requires him to steal the energy formula , putting his feelings aside . \nshue\'s character is eventually able to track down simon templar by putting the pieces ( the names of the catholic saints ) together , something no one else is able to do . \nwhen she finds him , they are left to team up and reclaim the energy formulas from tretiak . \nthe saint is very action-packed , with few slow points . \nthe sound was very well done and added to the many intense moments . \nalong the course of the movie , there are even a few , although brief moments of comedy . \nthese moments are almost always thanks to kilmer\'s extraneous , very convincing disguises and personalities . \nall in all , a rather enjoyable movie with nearly non-stop action . \n'~pos

' \" the animal \" is a marginally inspired comedy that only manages to lumber along , generating just enough momentum to keep it from stalling . \nit\'s clunky and slow , like watching an 18-wheeler trying to accelerate up a hill . \nthere are certainly better things you can do with your time . \nactually , if you\'ve seen the trailer , then you already know the plot and have seen its funniest moments . \nthe story centers on bland marvin ( rob schneider ) , who is an evidence clerk at the local police department that yearns to be a real officer . \nbut he\'s afflicted with loser-itis . \ndogs attack him , neighbors torment him , children bully him , and his co-workers ignore him . \ntruthfully , with his bad haircut ( seemingly modeled after weird al yankovic , little richard , and giant poodles ) and his unenthusiastic demeanor , we\'d probably throw tomatoes at him just for fun . \nthis is actually bad because you can\'t like a character if you can\'t develop sympathy for him . \nwe never do , and it may be just as well that he drives off a cliff and plummets to the canyon floor . \nhowever , marvin is found by an eccentric doctor ( michael caton ) who uses a radical and experimental procedure to save him , implanting our doofus with various animal parts and organs . \nas a result , marvin develops heightened senses and increased agility and speed . \nhe can smell drugs hidden anywhere on a body , swim with the speed of a dolphin , and can run as fast as a cheetah . \nimagine the comedic possibilities that arise from this operation . \nwith his enhanced abilities , he could now reap vengeance on all those who have shunned him . \nhowever , the spirit of the film takes a raunchy turn , and instead , marvin spends most of his time trying to subdue or satiate his voracious appetite and his animalistic , sexual urges . \ngoats beware ! \nhe also chases cats , urinates to mark his territory , or growls at his enemies . \nwhat he should\'ve done was stick his head in the sand like an ostrich . \nequally tenuous is its other running joke , which involves one of his friends ( guy torry ) who constantly complains that everyone is treating him too nicely because he\'s black . \n \" it\'s reverse racism , \" he declares as he blows smoke into the faces of strangers but none of them says anything . \nthis element doesn\'t work the first time it\'s mentioned , and it becomes increasingly trite with every recurrence . \nyou don\'t have to be as wise as an owl to realize that \" the animal \" is tame . \nif there\'s any reason to see this film , it\'s to see colleen haskell who makes her big screen debut . \nremember her ? \nshe was voted off in week 11 of the 13-week program , \" survivor . \" \nhere , she plays marvin\'s sunny love interest . \nwhile her role required very little actual acting , she seemed very comfortable ( even when marvin licks the side of her face like a lapping dog . . . yuck ! ) . \nwith her adorable disposition , radiant smile , and playful innocence , she could be a meg ryan in the making . \nit\'s too bad that she\'s in such a mediocre offering \n'~neg

'romeo is bleeding wants to carry the unusual flavor of reservoir dogs or bad lieutenant . \nwith director peter medak , whose previous credits include the good films let him have it and the krays , and top-notch character actors gary oldman and lena olin , they seemed likely to be a successful combination . \nthose mentioned films , however , brought something to the screen that romeo is bleeding did not : a solid , well-written screenplay . \ncall me cynical , but the jobs of writer and producer don\'t seem to mix well . \ngary oldman plays jack grimaldi , a good cop turned bad , selling information to the mob and cheating on his wife . \nhis cheating is obvious enough to obtain his nickname , although the name doesn\'t provide any insight or analogy to the shakespearean character . \njack has become addicted to \" feeding the hole \" , a hole in the ground where he stores his payoff money . \nwhen he realizes his colleagues are being shot , he feebly attempts to get out . \ngary oldman\'s performance is disappointingly weak ; he seems nearly bored . \nin the process , he also gets tangled-up with mona demarkov , a russian mobsterette who wants to take over the territory from top boss falcone , played adequately by roy scheider . \ndemarkov , played by lena olin , is a tough but tremendously sexy woman with seemingly no problems maneuvering within the mob world . \nthis character is combination of both linda hamilton and arnold schwarznegger from terminator 2 . i can\'t remember seeing a character quite like her . \nafter being shot , handcuffed , and thrown in the back seat of a car , she still manages to cause an accident , kick out the windshield with her legs , grab a suitcase full of money ( plus some important documentation ) , climb through the rubble , land on her shot leg , and still succeed at running for safety . \nwhat a woman ! \nlena olin\'s performance is the only glimmer in this dismal film . \nanabella sciorra is wasted in her role as romeo\'s wife . \nthere is little insight into her character . \nshe\'s depressed , she makes obvious references , she mopes around the house . \njuliette lewis , as romeo\'s girlfriend , is treated with the same cliche attitudes , although ms . lewis\' portrayal certainly didn\'t improve it . \nboth women were anything but sexy or attractive . \npoorly developed characters aside , the screenplay also suffers from several logistical problems . \nit is so discouraging to watch a film and want to shout at the main character ( not ) to do something . \nfor example , jack and his friends attend a funeral to hang in the background to scope-out the mob scene . \nfine . \njack spots the big boss with his goons by the gravesite . \nfine . \nwhat does jack proceed to do ? \nhe brushes his friends off by telling them he isn\'t feeling well , then strolls over to the boss . \nwhy ? \nthe boss had all ready threatened him ; falcone simply takes the opportunity to issue more threats by ordering his goons to take off some of jack\'s toes by the gravesite . \ni guess they weren\'t worried about any federal agents lingering around after the funeral . . . . \nor here\'s another : demarkov set-up her own death by cutting off her arm with a circular saw . \nshe proceeded to set the place on fire . \nwouldn\'t the flames burn off the fingerprints ? \naren\'t dental records more important ? \nas bright and resourceful as she was supposed to be , couldn\'t she come up with a better plot ? \n ( and it took her no time at all to get a good-fitting , functional prosthesis . ) \nlack of attention to detail certainly adds up in a film . \nthis film doesn\'t even add up the large details . \nthere is little or no consistency in the story-line . \nnot much makes sense . \nthe direction lacks cohesion , surprising from a director whose previous credits are impeccable . \nthe moods shift , the styles shift , and no one can seem to decide if it is a serious film or satire of one . \nso while it certainly isn\'t reservoir dogs , it certainly isn\'t diva . \nthere\'s plenty more to tear apart in this film . \nmy advice to someone who hasn\'t seen it to to wait until it comes on video . \nthere are some quotable lines that would provide a campy evening if not taken seriously . \nit\'s not a boring film , just not a good one . \nor an intelligent one . \n'~neg
'i\'ve never been a member of the robin williams fan club . \na little bit of his improvisationaly schtick goes a long way , and i sometimes feel as though i\'m watching a 40-year-old class clown . \nin his films , williams has often tried to balance his mania with touchy-feely emotion , leading to wildly uneven performances . \nmrs . \ndoubtfire seemed ready-made for the same problems , but instead it proves to be williams\' best comic screen project yet . \nwhile it still contains some characteristic self-indulgence , mrs . \ndoubtfire is nonetheless an engaging belly-laugh comedy served up with high energy . \nwilliams stars as daniel hillard , a cartoon voiceover artist with a penchant for irresponsible behavior . \none such incident proves one too many for wife miranda ( sally field ) , and she files for a divorce . \nunemployed , living in a disastrously unkempt apartment and faced with limited time with his three beloved children , daniel decides to respond to miranda\'s ad for an afternoon housekeeper . \nhe turns to his brother frank ( harvey fierstein ) , a theatrical makeup artist , and emerges as euphegenia doubtfire , a matronly 65-year-old englishwoman . \ndaniel uses his access to the house to keep an eye on miranda\'s flirtation with a wealthy client ( pierce brosnan ) , to spend time with the children , and to learn something about responsible parenting , all the while trying to keep his identity hidden from the people who know him best . \nmrs . doubtfire has to overcome a mountain of implausibilities to work , and basically it does so . \nthe most crucial is that no one in the family recognizes daniel , and thanks to the fantastic special makeup that\'s instantly believable . \nit may be one of the most convincing transformations ever committed to film , making dustin hoffman\'s dorothy michaels look like milton berle . \nmore problematic was a series of calls daniel makes to miranda posing as nannies from hell ; it\'s a bit hard to swallow that she doesn\'t recognize any of the voices as her husband\'s . \nperhaps the biggest contrivance we\'re asked to swallow is that daniel could make a quick change into mrs . doubtfire in a few minutes . \nthere\'s more to realistic makeup than slapping on a latex mask . \nfortunately , these are inconsistencies which only attract attention as the credits roll . \nduring the film , i was generally too busy laughing . \nafter getting off to a slow start involving too much of williams\' riffing , mrs . \ndoubtfire kicks into high gear once the wig and pads are in place . \ndaniel\'s frantic attempt to fool a court officer is wonderful , as is the climactic restaurant sequence , even though i saw the resolutions coming a mile away . \nclearly , most of the credit for doubtfire\'s success goes to robin williams . \nit took putting him in drag , but for once he plays a comic character that isn\'t just robin williams with a different name . \nhe thoroughly inhabits euphegenia doubtfire , and seems to relish the scenes in which he gets to play her as blunt and foul-mouthed . \nwisely , he never aims for saintly . \nhis responses to the intrusion of new suitor stu are often petty , but the kind of thing most of us might do with the benefit of anonymity . \nit\'s one of mrs . \ndoubtfire\'s charms that neither daniel nor miranda is perfect , just people trying to be better . \nas miranda , sally field is solid in a background role , and pierce brosnan is nicely understated as stu . \nthe children are also good , although mara wilson is almost oppressively cute as the youngest . \nthe supporting players merely step aside and allow williams to do his thing . \nit\'s easy to see mrs . \ndoubtfire as little more than tootsie warmed over , and it\'s true that there are both broad themes and specific details in common . \nbut mrs . \ndoubtfire manages to carve out its own space , particularly through the surprisingly honest moments involving a judge\'s decision and the ultimate status of daniel and miranda\'s relationship . \nthere\'s nothing dazzlingly new in mrs . \ndoubtfire , but there are plenty of laughs , and good comedies are always in short supply . \nand it\'s nice to see robin williams just act for a change . \n'~pos
'54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \na greater writer might have created a lyrical sentence for each of those adjectives , flowing in lovely arangements with soaring metaphors . \ni , however , would rather cut to the chase . \n54 is dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \nthere is nothing in it -- not a glimpse of depth , nor a shimmer of intelligence or insight . \nthere is no electricity in any of the scenes , or a moment of interest in the story or its subplots . \nand it\'s underdeveloped , and features an array of bland characters played by actors who think they\'re in this year\'s boogie nights . \nthey are so wrong . \nthe picture has been assembled by mark christopher . \nbased on this film , i don\'t know how he got a job in the business . \n54 is supposed to be an amazing insight into the world of the dance club of the same name , which originated in the 70s and closed down in the 80s . \ni don\'t know if this film went into production after boogie nights was released , but christopher has managed to plagiarize paul thomas anderson\'s brilliant work in every possible way , from the framework of the plot down to the style of the cinematography . \nwhat it lacks is everything that made boogie nights great : depth , intelligence , energy , fascinating characters , and challenging themes . \n54 can\'t even measure up to the last days of disco , which is flawed , but still smart and entertaining . \nit\'s remarkably bad timing , i\'d say , to release a film this tedious after a couple of noteworthy pictures of the same kind . \ni have exaggerated , though : there is one interesting character , and one terrific performance . \nthat character is steve rubell , played with more perceptiveness by mike myers than this limp production deserves . \nsteve rubell is the owner of studio 54 , and if christopher had focused on him , then myers could have forced a good film out of this wreck all by himself . \nalas , we are instead guided to endure the trials of a young man named shane ( ryan phillippe ) , a going-nowhere new jersey teen who gets a job in the club , thanks to rubell\'s homosexual impulses . \nit\'s here that he meets his friends , the array of uninteresting characters : his co-worker , greg ( brecklin meyer ) , his wife , anita ( salma hayek ) , and , of course , the love interest , julie black ( neve campbell ) . \nshane is just an innocent young fool in the beginning , and he has a reasonably sturdy home life . \n ( some of the scenes with his father border on interesting , while heather matarazzo , who plays his sister , pushes phillippe off the screen . ) \nbut he decides to envelop himself in the disco scene , and succumb to peer pressure and to drugs . \nwhy his \" friends \" push him into drugs is never really explained , but the fact that they are \" friends \" is questioned only is superficial ways ( greg gets really mad at shane because he\'s been elevated to bartender status ) . \nthere isn\'t a single conflict that takes center stage , except that shane has some kind of unexplored reservation with the business in which he works . \nmost of the film is dumb , and most of the dialogue is inane . \nthere\'s a scene late in the film in which shane confronts julie black , and , in the next scene , they\'re arm-in-arm without a bit of development . \nthen , they\'re kissing in a bowling alley ! \nthis is five minutes of material , thrown into the picture at the last minute ( well past the one-hour mark , and this isn\'t a long film to begin with ) . \ncampbell is a talented actress , but she needs a role that gives her a little depth . \nthis one doesn\'t . \nand phillippe has almost no presence whatsoever ; this performance pales in comparison to mark whalberg\'s star-making role in boogie nights . \nhe seems dumb and misguided , and his voice never changes tone . \ni guess he was picked for the color of his hair and the shape of his body , but he seems pretty lanky to me . \nhe\'s all wrong for a lead role , but it doesn\'t help that christopher has forgotten to develop his characters . \nby the end of 54 , shane\'s most notable trait is his stupid , fake accent . \nthe rest of the performances are wasted . \nhayek is an energetic , talented young actress , and does almost nothing here . \nmeyer is endearing , but allowed to be no deeper than cardboard . \nonly myers , by sheer force of talent , manages to rise above christopher\'s wading-pool of a script . \nrubell has been written just as depthless as the rest of the characters , but myers is good enough to inject subtleties that help round out the performance . \nin fact , myers is the sole reason to see 54 , and all it really does is make you wish that the film had revolved around him . \ni\'ve read that studio 54 has been recreated down to the last detail . \nfrankly , i don\'t care . \nit\'s easy to recreate something technical like this . \na fairly skilled production designer and a few carpenters can manage such a task . \nbesides , christopher keeps the lights so low that the sets are invisible , anyway . \naside from myers\' performance , 54 is a complete failure . \nit\'s dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \nsome may find my comparisons to boogie nights unfair , but they\'re so obvious to me . \nin any event , 54 is pallid without the contrast . \nit doesn\'t even work as mindless entertainment : it\'s so shallow that the most escapist viewers are likely to dismiss it . \nso , don\'t forget those key words : dull , perfunctory , uninspired , and boring . \neverything else i said was just padding . \n'~neg
'weir is well-respected in hollywood for turning scripts with difficult subject-matter into deceptively simple , powerful films , the mosquito coast ( utopia ) and fearless ( post-traumatic stress disorder ) among them . \nin the truman show , weir essentially breathes life into the now-tired concept of media-manipulation by tackling the material from the inside-out . \nit certainly helps that he has an underrated performer in top-form playing the title character , truman burbank . \nby now you must be aware of the premise : unbeknownst to him , truman ( carrey ) is the star of his own tv series , a 24-7 peep-show in which he is surrounded by actors and placed in loosely scripted situations ; people around the world tune in for the voyeuristic thrill of his genuine reactions to fictitious stimulants . \n`seahaven\' , his hometown , and the show itself , are the brainchild of christof ( harris ) , who presides over his creation in the base of a fake moon , directing over 500 cameras and hundreds of actors and extras . \nfor 30 years , truman suspects nothing-`we accept the reality we\'re given , \' poses christof-but a desire to break free of the sunny town and visit a long lost love in `fiji\' ( mcelhone , who was actually an actress fired by christof for trying to break the confidentiality agreement ) overwhelms him . \nthus , christof and his team suddenly find themselves working twice as hard to keep the veneer of seahaven intact , lest truman discover the world outside and put an end to the highly-rated program . \nin a few broad strokes , weir creates a convincing second-reality , and he has the good sense not to bring christof into the picture until almost three-quarters through . \nthis allows us to comprehend and accept truman\'s world before we contextualize it . \nfor all his madness , christof has shown the world a place without violence and hardship , and demonstrated that a human being can function well within it . \ntruman is an inspiration to his audience because he grew up to be , well , so darn nice ; like a sibling ( or , perhaps more appropriately , a caged animal in an interactive zoo ) , they want to see him succeed . \nthe surrealistic soap opera is completely plausible thanks to a tight screenplay and a sympathetic carrey-he really is an everyman here , abandoning his facial contortions in favour of a credible , wide-eyed bewilderment . \ncinematically , the truman show is impeccable , stylishly photographed by peter biziou and littered with symbolic images . \nas well , it employs wojciech kilar\'s piece \" zycie za zycie\' masterfully and beautifully . \nif the film has any flaws , one may find them in laura linney\'s characterization as meryl , truman\'s \" wife \" ( i doubt that betty crocker impersonation would fool anyone ) , and in a subplot involving truman\'s `father\' , which feels curiously incomplete . \nthere are a few stupendous sequences , and the film pulls off a wonderful trick : we become truman\'s audience as much as the loyal viewers in the film . \nthey wear buttons asking `how will it end ? \' \ni couldn\'t wait to know myself , though i didn\'t exactly want it to end , for this inspired movie is possibly the best-and most complex-summer picture in years . \n'~pos

'part one of \" the strangest movies ever made \" series at www . mediajunkies . com \nby scott watson \n[light spoilers , nothing you shouldn\'t read] \nexistenz has been called \" a gooey matrix \" , and while this is a correct description in some ways , in others it is completely off . \nthe only thing the two films have in common is the idea of a virtual reality that is indistinguishable from normal , \" real \" reality . \na major difference is that \" the matrix \" has a base reality that is obviously the true reality , while existenz does the impossible and makes us accept the most bizarre reality ever as true . \nand oh what a reality it is . \ndavid cronenberg has shown us before that he knows how to create strange movies ( naked lunch , crash ) , but this one is one of the strangest . \nmaybe it\'s because of how the mundane is mixed with the bizarre . \ntechnology is organic , but only some of it . \ncars are normal . \ngas stations are the same . \ncell phones are glowing bug like appendages . \nyou jack into a virtual reality game using a quivering pink gooey animal like apparatus ( referred to simply as a \" pod \" ) . \nhigh technology has been replaced with organic creatures , and it provides a truly surreal setting for the characters . \na famous game designer , allegra geller ( a fine looking jennifer jason leigh ) , flees a demonstration of her latest game , existenz , after an assassination attempt . \nshe is on the run ( from who , i\'m still not sure ) , and has to save her pod by playing her game with \" someone friendly \" . \nthat someone friendly is her dubious companion and security guard , ted pikul ( jude law ) . \nunfortunately he is lacking a fundamental requirement for playing , a bioport . \nsort of a hole in your spine ( ok , exactly like a hole in your spine ) , a bioport allows you to plug the vaguely entrail-looking wires from the pod into you , allowing you to play the game . \nluckily a bioport can be installed easily ( they install them in malls ) , so off they go to get one . \nafter a crazy series of events at the local country gas station , they are able to plug in and play existenz . \nthe plot itself is a surreal melding of conspiracies , reality distortion , chinese restaurants , and multi appendaged amphibian things ( \" it\'s a sign of the times \" ) . \nbut the plot , while cohesive in it\'s own creepy way is secondary to just trying to figure out what the hell is going on in this universe . \ncronenberg just slaps this weird organic-tech world into the viewers lap , and it\'s up to you to figure out how all these things work . \nand that\'s the true joy of this film , entering the vaguely nightmarish world in which existenz takes place . \nyou learn a little bit piece by piece ( oh , they make pods out of those ) , and it\'s just enough to get you to accept the world that is presented to you . \nthere are all kinds of twists and turns as the characters wander around , including a fantastic scene in a chinese restaurant that will leave you trying to assemble something out of your moo goo gai pan for months afterwards . \nalso the bioports are occasionally used for things other than porting into existenz , the specifics of which i will leave for you to discover . \nthere\'s lots of little things that set off the weird-o-meter , like the little tiny pods that you can buy in the video game store , the two headed amphibian creature , and why that guy at the gas station\'s name appears to be \" gas \" . \nit all adds up to a supremely far out trip , and given the choice i think i would rather live in the matrix\'s virtual world . . . \noh wait , i already do . \n'~pos

'good films are hard to find these days . \ngreat films are beyond rare . \nproof of life , russell crowe\'s one-two punch of a deft kidnap and rescue thriller , is one of those rare gems . \na taut drama laced with strong and subtle acting , an intelligent script , and masterful directing , together it delivers something virtually unheard of in the film industry these days , genuine motivation in a story that rings true . \nconsider the strange coincidence of russell crowe\'s character in proof of life making the moves on a distraught wife played by meg ryan\'s character in the film -- all while the real russell crowe was hitching up with married woman meg ryan in the outside world . \ni haven\'t seen this much chemistry between actors since mcqueen and mcgraw teamed up in peckinpah\'s masterpiece , the getaway . \nbut enough with the gossip , let\'s get to the review . \nthe film revolves around the kidnapping of peter bowman ( david morse ) , an american engineer working in south america who is kidnapped during a mass ambush of civilians by anti-government soldiers . \nupon discovering his identity , the rebel soldiers decide to ransom him for $6 million . \nthe only problem is that the company peter bowman works for is being auctioned off , and no one will step forward with the money . \nwith no choice available to her , bowman\'s wife alice ( ryan ) hires terry thorne ( crowe ) , a highly skilled negotiator and rescue operative , to arrange the return of her husband . \nbut when things go wrong -- as they always do in these situations -- terry and his team ( which includes the most surprising casting choice of the year : david caruso ) take matters into their own hands . \nthe film is notable in that it takes this very simple story line and creates a complex and intelligent character-driven vehicle filled with well-written dialogue , shades of motivation , and convincing acting by all the actors . \nthe script is based on both a book ( the long march to freedom ) and a magazine article pertaining to kidnap/ransom situations , and the story has been sharply pieced together by tony gilroy , screenwriter of the devil\'s advocate and dolores claiborne . \nthe biggest surprise for me was not the chemistry between crowe and ryan , but that between crowe and david caruso . \ndug out from b-movie hell , caruso pulls off a gutsy performance as crowe\'s right hand gun while providing most of the film\'s humor . \nryan cries a lot and smokes too many cigarettes , david morse ends up getting everyone at the guerilla camp to hate him , and crowe provides another memorable acting turn as the stoic , gunslinger character of terry thorne . \nthe most memorable pieces of the film lie in its action scenes . \nthe bulk of those scenes , which bookend the movie , work extremely well as establishment and closure devices for all of the story\'s characters . \nthe scenes are skillfully crafted and executed with amazing accuracy and poise . \ndirector taylor hackford mixes both his old-school style of filmmaking with the dizziness of a lars von trier film . \nproof of life is a thinking man\'s action movie . \nit is a film about the choices men and women make in the face of love and war , and the sacrifices one makes for those choices -- the sacrifices that help you sleep at night . \n'~pos
'after enduring mariah carey\'s film debut , glitter , i\'m reminded of a bit from chris rock\'s bigger and blacker . \nin response to women saying that they can raise a child without a man , rock says , \" you can drive a car with your feet , but that don\'t mean it should be done . \" \nto that i say , you can give mariah carey a movie , but that certainly don\'t mean it should be done . \nsure , there are plenty of pop star film vehicles out there -- from the beatles\' a hard day\'s night to the spice girls\' spice world -- but none have been so vapidly pointless or laughable as glitter . \neverything about this complete tripe is ludicrous . \nstart off with the story , which -- as gruesomely predictable as it is -- is the least offensive part of the movie . \nthe film is inexplicably set in the 80s , a period piece that really shows no sign of its period except for a few chicks in leg warmers . \nworse yet , everyone\'s speaking late 90s hip-hop slang in what should be 1983 . \nmeant to be partially autobiographical , carey plays billie frank , a young singer in new york who struggles to overcome a rough childhood and abandonment by her alcoholic mother . \ninfluential club dj julian dice , a . k . a . \" lucky 7 \" ( max beesley playing a bad mix of puff daddy and robert de niro ) , hears her sing on a track , and decides to make her a star . \nin predictably rapid succession , billie and dice fall for each other , she starts hitting it big , dice gets jealous and starts acting like an ass , and suddenly billie\'s on \" the roller coaster of superstardom . \" \nin the meantime , billie is on an emotional hunt for her missing mom . \ni won\'t give away the ending , but -- honestly -- just think of unicorns and rainbows . . . \nyou\'ll figure it out . \nthe movie screams to be made with camp , and that could\'ve been fun . \nbut the filmmakers thought making the bulk of glitter weepy and dramatic would be better . \nwhat a mistake . \nthe brief attempts at comic relief -- as in a scene where an effeminate russian-sounding director gets wacky with filming billie\'s first music video -- go over like lead balloons . \ninstead , the audience at my screening tended to laugh loudest during mariah\'s most dramatic scenes . \nwhich brings us to the performances , of which there\'s nothing good that can be said . \nmariah is primarily seen with a wide-eyed deer-in-the-headlights look frozen on her face . \nshe actually looks scared during her one love scene . \nbut you have to wonder if the writing isn\'t even worse . \nso much of the dialogue is so hackneyed and watered down for carey\'s virginal target audience that it\'s probably impossible for any actor to pull it off with aplomb . \neven the characters couldn\'t have been written more absurdly . \nthey\'re all members of a barbie playset : the important film director who swoons , \" billie , i\'d love to put you in a movie i\'m making , \" and the big-time record executive who takes billie\'s demo tape and says , \" oh , i\'ll make sure the whole team listens to it in the morning . \" \neveryone in the film is a device , and it\'s painful to keep watching just to see another one appear . \nto say more would be a waste . \nthere\'s so much wrong with this film . \nand , it pains me that mariah carey -- with her ego and sanity in such fragile condition these days , as evidenced by her multiple hospital stays -- will have to suffer through all the negative reviews she\'s likely to get . \nbut , then again , i had to suffer through her movie . \n'~neg
'i must admit i\'m going to be a bit biased in my review of the new romantic comedy serendipity , because that also defines how i met my current girlfriend . \nthe magic and mystery of our fated encounter is also embodied in the quirkiness and freshness of the very funny and very romantic serendipity . \ni am not a big fan of the romantic comedy genre , but something drew me to this film . \nmaybe it was the casting of the underrated jeremy piven in a supporting role , and the hilarious eugene levy . \nmaybe it was my hope that john cusack would get the redemption he justly deserves after such crap as high fidelity , con air , and pushing tin . \nbut maybe it was because i feel as giddy as a school kid right now with this whole romantic thing currently in my life . \nthe story of serendipity is simple . \ntwo people , john trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale , looking ever so hot ) , have a chance encounter over a pair of gloves -- with buck henry smack dab in the middle . \ncharmed beyond repair , these two knuckleheads grab a sundae together at a caf ? called serendipity , talk about that irresponsible thing called fate and the avenues it leads people down , and spend a few hours at the local ice skating rink . \nbut with each of them already involved with other parties , sara has john write his name and number on a $5 bill and she writes her name and number on a copy of love in the time of cholera . \nsara declares that if this \" thing \" -- let\'s just call it love -- is destined to happen , fate will bring them together in the future . \nyears later and on opposite coasts of america , john and sara -- both engaged but still unsure whether they have found their soul mates -- decide to seek each other out to rest their doubts . \nwhat happens then is an enjoyable and often hilarious cat-and-mouse game with the fates - involving such items as mistaken identity , a graduate homage , john corbett as a freaky new age musician , and eugene levy as an irate and crazed salesman -- to find out if that \" thing \" was right after all . \nfortunately , first-time screenwriter marc klein has sketched strong , well-rounded , characters to propel a predictable and corny narrative . \ncoupled with deft directing by michael chelsom ( director of the very unfunny town and country and the very funny funny bones ) and the use of time-lapse camera work to illustrate the passage of years -- the film comes off with genuine believability and sincerity . \nboth piven and molly shannon make nice sidekick characters \non the flipside , films such as you\'ve got mail , made in heaven , and even high fidelity are the quiet inspirations for the film\'s main journey at hand . \nbut it\'s what happens to the unexpecting characters left behind in the romantic wake after john and sara find happiness this is the most unsettling part of the picture . \n'~pos
